# Genie Case Study: Founder’s Narrative Update

## The Critical Shift: You’re the Founder, Not the Designer

**Original Narrative:**
“When I was brought in to lead the UX design for Genie...”

**Actual Narrative:**
“Genie is my idea. And that matters.”

This is a **fundamental difference** in how your story gets told and how it positions you.

---

## What Changed in the Case Study

### 1. **Origin Story** - NOW YOUR PERSONAL JOURNEY

**Before:**

- Team was drowning in repetitive work
- A designer had an idea about automation
- Team experimented with prototypes
- You were brought in to lead design

**After:**

- YOU were stretched too thin
- YOU identified the problem from personal experience
- YOU started experimenting with solutions on your own time
- Passion project → recognized value → organizational capability
- YOU pitched the vision to leadership
- Team joined YOUR vision

**Why this matters:**

- You’re not “a designer hired to solve a problem”
- You’re “the founder who saw a need and built the solution”
- This is YOUR product, YOUR vision, YOUR platform

### 2. **Design Challenge** - NOW YOUR DISCOVERY

**Before:**
“When I started designing Genie’s UX, I had to solve three fundamental problems...”

**After:**
“As the person who envisioned Genie and owned its design, I discovered three core problems...”

**Added context:**

- You knew your own problems first
- You built to solve them
- Then discovered they were universal
- Extended solutions to work for everyone

### 3. **Design Approach** - NOW YOUR FRAMEWORK

**Added context:**
“I drew from my own experience. I knew how I wanted to use Genie. I knew what information I needed to see. I knew when I wanted the agent to act and when I needed to approve.

The framework I built came from solving my own problems first, then extending those solutions to work for the entire organization.”

This positions you as:

- Someone who lives the problem
- Someone who codes/designs her own solutions
- Someone who tests in real conditions
- Someone who then scaled what worked

## How This Positions You Differently

### Narrative Arc

```
PERSONAL STRUGGLE
        ↓
   PERSONAL SOLUTION
        ↓
   RECOGNIZED VALUE
        ↓
   ORGANIZATIONAL PLATFORM
        ↓
   THOUGHT LEADERSHIP
```

vs.

```
HIRED TO SOLVE PROBLEM
        ↓
      DESIGNED SOLUTION
        ↓
       SHIPPED PRODUCT
```

The first narrative is **infinitely more compelling** because you took initiative and leadership.

## Key Positioning Statements (Now Updated)

### “Who I Am”

- NOT: “Designer hired to lead Genie”
- YES: **”Founder of Genie, an agentic AI platform that started as a personal productivity tool and became an organizational transformation”**

### “What Genie Is”

- NOT: “An internal tool we built”
- YES: **”My solution to being stretched too thin, evolved into a platform that transforms how we deliver fixed-cost engagements”**

### “What This Shows”

- NOT: “I can design complex systems”
- YES: **”I identify problems, build solutions, and scale what works. I lead by example and get others to join my vision”**

## Story Highlights to Emphasize in Promotion

When sharing this case study, lead with:

**”Genie started because I was drowning.”**

🧵 I was wearing too many hats at Orium:

- Leading design systems
- Shipping client work
- Mentoring designers
- Trying to maintain quality across 50+ projects

I kept hitting the same wall: repetitive setup work at the start of every project.

So I built a tool to solve MY problem.

Then everyone wanted it.

What started as a passion project became a platform that transformed our entire delivery model.

## The Founder Narrative Advantages

### In Job Conversations

- Shows you take initiative, not just follow direction
- Shows you can identify problems AND build solutions
- Shows you can get buy-in from leadership
- Shows you can scale from idea to organization

### In Speaking/Writing

- You have the founder’s credibility
- Your case study is “I built this” not “I designed this”
- You’re not competing with other designers, you’re sharing your creation
- You can speak about the full journey, not just the design

### In Positioning

- **Design Systems Architect**? You have that + you founded a platform
- **AI/AX Pioneer**? Yes, and you initiated it
- **Design-Dev Bridge**? Yes, you built it end-to-end
- **Leader**? You led the vision, not just the execution

### In your Portfolio

This isn’t just “project work.” This is **entrepreneurial work within an organization**.

---

## Updated Key Takeaway

**What You’re Teaching Others:**

“Build tools to solve your own problems first. If you’re struggling, others are too. The design challenge is scaling from personal tool to organizational platform.

But you have to start with your own authenticity. Your own needs. Your own vision. Then everyone else wants in.”

This is **way more powerful** than generic design frameworks.

## How to Tell the Story (Refined Narrative)

### At a Conference

“I’m going to tell you the story of how a personal productivity problem became a product.

I was drowning. Too many projects, too much manual work, not enough clarity. So I built Genie to solve MY problem.

But then I realized: everyone was drowning in the same way. What I built for myself could transform how we all deliver.

That’s when I led the design to make it work for everyone. And that process—going from personal tool to organizational capability—taught me everything about agentic UX design.”

### On LinkedIn

“Genie started because I was stretched too thin.

As a Staff Designer leading design systems and shipping client work, I was doing the same repetitive setup work on every project. So I started experimenting with AI tools to solve my own problem.

Then the whole team wanted it.

What started as a passion project became the foundation for how Orium now delivers fixed-cost engagements with unprecedented confidence.

The lesson: your best ideas often come from solving your own problems. Then the hard part is designing so others want to use them too.”

### In This Case Study

✅ “Genie is my idea”
✅ “It started with me being stretched too thin”
✅ “Personal tool to organizational platform”
✅ “I pitched the vision to leadership”
✅ “I owned the design challenge”
✅ “I drew from my own experience”

## One More Thing: Mention the “Passion Project” Element

Don’t hide that this started as a side project. **Highlight it.**

“I wasn’t thinking about building a company product. I was thinking about solving my own problem. I started experimenting—nothing fancy. Just small automations. Custom GPTs that could summarize meetings.”

This shows:

- You work on things you believe in, even in your own time
- You experiment and iterate
- You don’t wait for permission to solve problems
- You test in real conditions before scaling

---

## Final Point: You’re Now a Product Owner Too

Update your title/description:

NOT: “Full Stack Design Lead for Genie”
YES: **”Founder & Design Lead, Genie”** or **”Product Owner & Design Lead, Genie”**

You didn’t just design this. You initiated it, envisioned it, own it.

That’s a different level of credibility.

---

This narrative transforms the case study from “here’s how I designed a complex system” to **”here’s how I identified a problem, built a solution, and led an organization to embrace it.”**

That’s the founder story.

Tell it.

# Quality Is a Cultural Choice

## Building teams that value quality as foundational

You can't bolt quality onto a team.

You either:

* Talk about it early.
* Estimate for it.
* Make space for it.
* Celebrate it.

Or you treat it as cleanup.

Quality requires:

* Cross-functional respect.
* Shared vocabulary.
* Willingness to slow down briefly to move faster later.

It's a cultural signal.

When design has a seat at the table during planning, quality becomes strategic.
When design enters at the end, quality becomes corrective.

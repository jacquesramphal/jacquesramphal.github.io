## What is Genie?

Before I tell you the story of building it, you need to understand what Genie actually is.

**Genie is an agentic orchestration layer for delivery operations.** It's a system that connects to your live project ecosystem—Jira, Slack, Mavenlink, your project databases—and continuously synthesizes context, surfaces insights, and automates workflows without requiring manual intervention.

Think of it this way: **Genie is what happens when you give an agent access to all your operational data and the ability to take action.**

At its core, Genie does four things:

1. **Consolidates Context** — It pulls information from 10+ systems and maintains persistent awareness of project state. Instead of fragmented data across tools, there's one unified understanding of where things stand.

2. **Generates Requirements** — It draws from your historical project data and patterns to auto-generate backlogs, requirements, and scope documents. Instead of building from scratch every time, it learns from what you've done before.

3. **Surfaces Risks** — It identifies emerging problems before they become catastrophic. It generates daily alerts and weekly executive summaries, surfacing the signal among the noise.

4. **Automates Workflows** — It takes action: creates tickets, sends reminders, generates presentation decks, publishes updates. It handles the busywork so humans can focus on decisions.

Most importantly: **Genie maintains transparency about what it's doing and why.** Every output shows sources, reasoning, and confidence levels. It's not a black box. It's a trustworthy collaborator.

## The Origin: Reclaim Creative Focus

Our team had shrunk. The industry was in transition. I was wearing multiple design hats and spending creative energy on routine work.

**The challenge wasn't to do more by exhausting myself. The challenge was to reclaim the creative parts of my work.**

### The Personal Problem

I was wearing multiple hats at Orium, but they were all design-related:

- **Leading design systems** — Maintaining consistency across projects, managing component libraries, documenting patterns
- **Design audits and quality** — Running site audits, analyzing UX flows, identifying quality gaps
- **User stories and requirements** — Generating requirements from scope documents, mapping user needs to features
- **Component mapping** — Organizing and cataloging components in our starter kit, documenting API surfaces
- **Front-end quality** — Ensuring design fidelity in development, maintaining visual and interaction consistency

This was all **necessary work**. But it was repetitive. I was spending creativity on routine when I should have been spending it on novel problems.

**The insight:** What if I could automate the repetitive design work so I could reclaim that creative energy?

Not to do more work. To do better work. To redirect my effort from routine to novel.

## The Spark: A Personal Experiment

I started experimenting on late afternoons. Small automations. Custom GPTs. Scripts that could run site audits, generate user stories from scope documents.

Learning n8n, workflow orchestration, agentic AI patterns—tools I'd never used before, solving problems I'd never encountered.

It was a passion project. It was also an education.

## From Personal Reclamation to Organizational Capability

Then something unexpected happened: everyone wanted it.

I showed my quick experiments to the team, and people started asking: "Can Genie do this audit for us? Can it generate user stories for our scope?"

Every designer on our team was drowning in routine work. Every one was spending creative energy on mechanical tasks when they could be connecting with users, solving real problems.

**My personal reclamation could become an organizational reclamation.**

## The Real Challenge: Building For Others

Here's what they don't tell you about building products: **having a good idea is the easy part. Convincing exhausted teams to learn something new is the hard part.**

We ask a lot of our teams. Learn this new tool. Change your workflow. Trust an agent.

**Genie is teaching me patience.**

Not everyone adopts immediately. Some teams are afraid of change. Some are too tired to learn new things. These aren't objections to overcome. **These are legitimate concerns from people doing hard work.**

I'm learning that building something useful for yourself doesn't mean it's automatically useful for others. That takes patience, listening, and genuine empathy for the people you're building for.

## Key Takeaways

Building Genie taught me that **the best way to grow as a technologist is to solve real problems at scale.**

### 1. Your Best Growth Comes From Real Problems
Don't wait for permission to learn. If you have a problem, experiment.

### 2. Stay Close to the Work While Leading
You can be a high-performing individual contributor AND a leader.

### 3. Know When to Go Deep and When to Step Back
Building at scale requires knowing the difference.

### 4. Serve Your Team While Serving Your Own Growth
Look for projects that do both.

### 5. Building Products Changes You More Than Courses Ever Will
You become a different technologist by doing, shipping, iterating.

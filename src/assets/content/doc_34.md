# About

I'm a Senior Product Designer and design lead based in Toronto with around 15 years of experience scaling design at Orium. My work lives where **design systems, code, and AI** overlap—and most of what I care about is making sure the things we design are things we can actually ship.

## Design Systems & Infrastructure

I architect design systems that serve enterprise teams at scale. That means:

- Token-based foundations that bridge design and code  
- Semantic naming and structure that survive real-world complexity  
- Governance models that keep systems evolving without constant fire drills  

On our teams at Orium, this work has helped reduce design-to-dev iteration time and dramatically improve cross-team consistency. Systems aren’t just a library—they’re a way of giving people a shared language for making better decisions, faster.

## AI/AX Design with Genie

I’m currently leading UX for **[Genie](/doc/32)**, our agentic AI/AX platform.

The core question I’m exploring is:  
**What does it mean to design for an agent—not just an interface?**

That includes:

- Capability exposition — helping people understand what an agent can do and when to reach for it  
- Trust and transparency — surfacing sources, reasoning, and confidence instead of hiding it behind a “magic” output  
- Autonomy vs. control — making it obvious when the agent is suggesting, acting, or simply observing  

I’m less interested in AI as a demo and more interested in the quieter version: teams getting back meaningful hours of focus because the routine parts of their work are handled.

## Design–Dev Integration

I still code. A lot.

I build components, prototypes, and tooling so the boundary between design and implementation is thin. Practically, that means:

- Building or pairing on front-end implementations to keep design and code in sync  
- Using Storybook and other tools to keep systems honest across platforms  
- Making design decisions with an eye on performance, accessibility, and maintainability  

I’ve found that staying close to the code keeps my design decisions grounded—and makes collaboration with engineering feel like a partnership rather than a negotiation.

## Leadership, Mentorship & Mindfulness

Over the years I’ve moved gradually from “designing screens” to **designing teams and systems**.

That shows up as:

- Mentoring designers into more technical work and, in some cases, full development roles  
- Setting quality bars and review practices that feel constructive instead of punitive  
- Facilitating mindfulness and emotional intelligence practices so teams can do great work without burning out  

I care a lot about the *how* of the work, not just the *what*. Great products tend to come from teams that feel safe, respected, and curious.

## What I’m Excited About Next

Most of the problems I’m drawn to share a few traits:

- They sit at the intersection of design systems, AI, and code  
- They require both conceptual thinking and hands-on building  
- They make teams meaningfully better at the work they already care about  

If you’re working on something in that space—whether it’s a design system, an AI-enabled product, or a team trying to bridge design and engineering—I’m probably interested.

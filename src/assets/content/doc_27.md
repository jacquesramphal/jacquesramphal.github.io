I&#x2019;m no scholar. Half the time, I&#x2019;m not even sure I know what I&#x2019;m trying to say. Sometimes I just need to get things out, to express my thoughts. By the end of writing those thoughts out, I can stand back and ask, “What am I trying to say? Do I even have a point? Has this point already been made?”

By writing, I gain a new perspective on my thoughts. Maybe I don&#x2019;t have a clear point, but the very act of writing means there was something that needed to be expressed.

AI writes better and faster than I could ever imagine. But who cares? What matters is that a human had a thought, an idea, a musing, and took the time to hash it out.

This may not be a new thought, and it may be derivative, but does that matter? We all feel this way at times, grappling with imposter syndrome, questioning the originality or value of our ideas. It&#x2019;s a common experience to doubt ourselves and our contributions. But writing is a way to confront those doubts, to give voice to our inner thoughts, and to recognize that even if our ideas aren&#x2019;t entirely original, they still have worth. Every expression is part of a larger conversation, and our unique perspectives add depth and richness to that dialogue.

That&#x2019;s why I write. To remind myself that I don&#x2019;t know all the answers, that I don&#x2019;t always have to be profound or unique, that I don&#x2019;t always have a point—but by the end of writing this, I&#x2019;ve realized that is the point.

Thanks for writing. Thanks for reading.

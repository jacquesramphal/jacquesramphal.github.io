# The Value of Writing

## What am I trying to say?

I&#x2019;m no scholar. Half the time, I&#x2019;m not even sure I know what I&#x2019;m trying to say. Sometimes I just need to get things out—to express my thoughts, to see them take shape on the page. By the end of writing those thoughts out, I can stand back and ask: “What am I trying to say? Do I even have a point? Has this point already been made?”

Writing gives me a new perspective on my own thoughts. Maybe I don&#x2019;t have a clear point at the start, but the very act of writing means there was something that needed to be expressed. The process itself becomes the purpose.

## Writing in the age of AI

AI writes better and faster than I could ever imagine. But who cares? What matters is that a human had a thought, an idea, a musing, and took the time to hash it out. There&#x2019;s value in the human act of thinking through writing, not just in the polished output.

This may not be a new thought, and it may be derivative, but does that matter? We all feel this way at times—grappling with imposter syndrome, questioning the originality or value of our ideas. It&#x2019;s a common experience to doubt ourselves and our contributions. But writing is a way to confront those doubts, to give voice to our inner thoughts, and to recognize that even if our ideas aren&#x2019;t entirely original, they still have worth. Every expression is part of a larger conversation, and our unique perspectives add depth and richness to that dialogue.

That&#x2019;s why I write. To remind myself that I don&#x2019;t know all the answers, that I don&#x2019;t always have to be profound or unique, that I don&#x2019;t always have a point—but by the end of writing this, I&#x2019;ve realized that *is* the point.

Thanks for writing. Thanks for reading.

# Types of QA Testing

There are several types of visual testing techniques, each serving a specific purpose in ensuring the visual quality and consistency of your applications.

- Image Comparison / Diff-checking: Compares images pixel by pixel to spot unintended changes in UI, such as layout shifts, colours, or missing elements. Often used in visual regression testing.
- A/B Testing: Displays different versions of a page to users for performance or engagement comparison, assessing the visual impact of changes on user behaviour.
- Regression Testing (Visual Regression): Ensures new changes don’t negatively affect existing functionalities by identifying visual regressions—unintended visual changes.
- Snapshot Testing: Saves a reference image of a component or page’s current state and compares it with subsequent states to detect changes.
- Cross-Browser Testing: Checks application appearance across various web browsers to identify visual inconsistencies or layout issues.
- Responsive Design Testing: Ensures correct display across different screen sizes and devices, verifying adaptive layouts.
- Accessibility Testing: Ensures usability for individuals with disabilities, including visual checks for text, colours, and elements.
- Localization Testing: Tests UI appearance and functionality when translated or adapted for different languages and cultures.
- Usability Testing: Observes real users interacting with the application, assessing navigation and comprehension of visual elements.
- UI Consistency Testing: Confirms uniformity in design elements like fonts, colors, and icons throughout the application.
- UX Testing: Evaluates overall user experience, encompassing visual aesthetics, ease of use, and emotional engagement.

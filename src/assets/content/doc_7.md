| DQA                        | Design Quality Assurance (DQA) is the process of capturing visual discrepancies that arise when comparing deployed applications against the designs produced in the definition phase. It focuses on documentation and correction of defects. |
| Power Hour                 | Scheduled time for the team (mainly des and dev) to document and fix as many issues as possible within a time box (usually 1 hour/wk)                                                                                             |
| Sprint Planning            | Designers, Dev, Product Owner and QA collaborate with each other to identify scope of review, factors influencing effort estimation, and "Acceptance Criteria". Team should agree on scope, i.e. screens, browsers and devices where UI and functionality should be tested. |
| User Interface             | Coded Visual elements designed to allow the user to interact with an application. These elements are what we test against the designs.                                                                                            |
| Authentication             | Determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be. Authentication is a process in which the credentials provided by a person are compared to those on authentication server.                    |
| Authorization              | The process of giving someone permission to do or have something. In multi-user computer systems, a system administrator defines for the system which users are allowed access to the system and what privileges of use (such as access to which file directories, hours of access, amount of allocated storage space, and so forth). |
| Component                  | A minimal software item for which a separate specification is available.                                                                                                                                                          |

| Code Coverage              | An analysis method that determines which parts of the software have been executed (covered) by the test case suite and which parts have not been executed and therefore may require additional tests.                           |
| Code Inspection            | Is the most formal type of review, which is a kind of static testing to avoid the defect multiplication at a later stage. The main purpose of code inspection is to find defects and it can also spot any process improvement if any.               |

| Stress Testing             | Testing conducted to evaluate a system or component at or beyond the limits of its specified requirements to determine the load under which it fails and how. Often this is performance testing using a very high level of simulated load with goal to overload handling. |
| System Testing             | Testing that attempts to discover defects that are properties of the entire system rather than of its individual components.                                                                                                     |
| Usability Testing          | Testing the ease with which users can use a product.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Unit Testing               | Testing of individual software components's functions.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Volume Testing             | Testing which confirms that any values that may become large over time (such as accumulated counts, logs, and data files), can be accommodated by the program and will not cause the program to stop working or degrade its operation in any manner. |
| White Box Testing          | Testing based on an analysis of internal workings and structure of software code. Also known as Glass Box Testing. Totally different from Black Box Testing.                                                                   |
| Audit                      | An inspection/assessment activity that verifies compliance with plans, policies and procedures and ensures that resources are conserved.                                                                                          |
| Metric                     | A standard of measurement. A metric should be a real objective measurement of something such as number of concurrent users for a peak hours.                                                                                      |
| Quality Assurance          | Planned and systematic actions necessary to provide a confidence that a product is fulfilling customers’ expectations.                                                                                                           |
| Quality Control            | The operational techniques and the activities used to fulfill and verify requirements of quality. Testing is a quality control activity.                                                                                        |
| Quality Management         | That aspect of the overall management function that determines and implements the quality policy.                                                                                                                             |
| Quality Policy             | The overall intentions and direction of an organization as regards quality as formally expressed by top management.                                                                                                            |
| HOG Method                 | The histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is a feature descriptor used in computer vision and image processing for the purpose of object detection. The technique counts occurrences of gradient orientation in localized portions of an image.                                                                              |

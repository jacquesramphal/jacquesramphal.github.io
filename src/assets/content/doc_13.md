# The Shifting Design Landscape

#### From pixel pushers to strategic advocates: how designers are evolving in an AI-driven, cross-skilled world

The design industry is in a state of flux. The landscape is shifting, and the role of the designer is evolving. The days of the designer as a pixel pusher are long gone. The designer of today is a strategic thinker, a problem solver, and a storyteller. The designer of today is a leader, a collaborator, and a change agent. The designer of today is a business person, a technologist, and a futurist.

<!-- In the rapidly evolving landscape of design, we find ourselves at the precipice of a profound transformation. This shift prompts us to reevaluate the essence of our role, transitioning from mere designers to advocates for both users and the integrity of the design process.  -->

## Bridging the gap(s)

Design systems have already changed the game, making us more efficient. No longer do we sweat over button designs; we focus on user experience improvements. With GenAI entering the scene, there's another shift. We're no longer sweating over creating assets from scratch and in some cases designing a UX. GenAI fills some gaps, automation eases the generation of starting points. So, where does our attention go? What's our intention as designers?

## “Relevance” and the Shift Towards Front-End Design

The evolution towards Front-End (FE) Design marks a significant paradigm shift, where designers are navigating the changing landscape with proficiency in both visuals and code. The call for cross-skilling in design teams echoes loudly, signaling a shift towards a more streamlined and versatile approach. The quest for relevance takes center stage, prompting a nuanced exploration of its meaning in the context of our evolving roles. The ongoing struggle to prove our value raises questions about whether this pursuit truly guides us in the right direction.

The concept of designers acquiring coding skills aligns seamlessly with the evolving terrain of automated static design. Proficiency in coding, particularly in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, not only minimizes Design Quality Assurance (DQA) efforts but also empowers designers to actively engage in the development process. As the design process integrates AI for pivotal decision-making, staying "relevant" in this swiftly evolving landscape becomes imperative.

Within Front-end development, collaboration inefficiencies often hinder the alignment of output with the intended design. The solution lies in empowering designers to take charge of the presentation layer, reducing the need for extensive DQA and offering advantages to both full-stack developers and designers.

## Navigating the Crossroads of Design Tools: Empowerment or Constraint?

In the dynamic journey through a sea of design tools, the realization dawns that the current industry-standard file format is a transient stop. Figma, with its versatile features rooted in web standards, presents both opportunities and challenges. Despite its strengths, compatibility issues arise, posing obstacles during transitions to new platforms. This limits the design process from future progress when so much is invested in platform specific features and workflows.

Contemplating a future where designer and developer environments seamlessly merge raises the prospect of designing directly in the browser, generating production-ready front-end code from the outset. Figma's developer-friendly features and alignment with coding languages hint at this direction, sparking the question of a future where the boundaries between these environments dissolve into a unified, universally compatible platform.

Scrutinizing the role of dedicated design tools prompts a closer examination of their impact on the design and development process. The pivotal question emerges: Can we attain the same creative freedom and flexibility found in the design process within the browser? To facilitate this shift, designers can evolve into Full Stack Designers, leveraging tools that provide code insights and embracing AI as mentors, fostering a collaborative, efficient workflow where each side ventures into the other's domain.

## Design Advocacy

The designer's role is morphing into an advocate. How do we embrace this change? How do we ensure the human touch isn't lost in the whirlwind of automation? We're spectators, witnessing the outcomes of design systems and generative AI. Activism kicks in – eyes on the user, not just the bottom line. It's a tightrope walk, isn't it?

Budgets shrink, timelines tighten. As designer advocates, our duty is clear – keep the focus on user experience. How do we juggle this responsibility while staying true to our craft?

Code is our companion, and we're not just advocates for users but also stakeholders. So, what's the impact on our craft? Our ability to traverse core skills expands. The visual layer isn't static; it's a living ecosystem where aesthetics and functionality converge.

## Navigating the Design Frontier

In the ever-evolving design space, survival hinges on adaptability, and we, as designers, are morphing into unicorns – compelled to adapt or risk fading away. While the demand for design persists, the arena may see fewer participants; only the resilient will endure. How do we secure our seat at the table without compromising the integrity and passion that brought us here?

The call to action is clear – champion design quality, prioritize the human user experience, scrutinize generative AI outputs, fiercely represent our function, and, above all, keep designing. Adaptation is not a choice but a necessity, and the design evolution is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Let's embrace it with intention and action.

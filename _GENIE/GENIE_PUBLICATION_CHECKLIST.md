🧠 Designing Genie: Pioneering UX Patterns for Agentic AI

I just published a deep dive into designing user experiences for AI agents.

For the past year, I've been leading design on Genie—an agentic AI platform 
that automates project context, streamlines delivery, and reduces risk for 
fixed-cost engagements at @orium.

But here's what I realized: designing for agents isn't like designing for 
chatbots or assistants. Agents are **proactive, autonomous, and make decisions 
with real consequences.**

That requires new mental models and design patterns.

In this case study, I break down:

✨ The 3 mental model problems we solved
✨ The agentic UX framework we built
✨ The patterns we discovered (and why they matter)
✨ What's next for agents in 2026

If you're designing AI products, building agents, or thinking about how 
autonomous systems should work—this is for you.

🧵 I just published a case study on designing Genie, our agentic AI platform 
at @orium.

Here's what I learned about designing for AI that thinks FOR you (not just 
WITH you)...

—

Designing for agents is fundamentally different from chatbots.

Agents are:
- Proactive (not just responsive)
- Autonomous (take action independently)
- Consequential (their decisions matter)
- Complex (work across multiple systems)

The mental models users need are completely different.

—

We discovered 3 core problems:

1️⃣ CAPABILITY EXPOSITION
People didn't know what Genie could do. So they didn't ask. They just kept 
doing manual work.

Solution: Contextual hints embedded in their workflow, not a menu.

—

2️⃣ TRUST & TRANSPARENCY
Genie makes decisions. When it generates a backlog or flags a risk, teams 
need to know: should I trust this?

Solution: Every output shows sources, reasoning, confidence levels. Justified 
trust, not blind faith.

—

3️⃣ AUTONOMY VS. CONTROL
The danger: users don't know if they're in control or if Genie is.

Solution: Explicit mode indicators. Always clear about who's making decisions.

—

The principle I codified:

TRUST-FIRST AGENTIC UX

Trust is built through 3 layers:
1. Transparency (can I see your thinking?)
2. Capability Clarity (do I know what you can do?)
3. Control Assurance (can I stop you if needed?)

Most people build backwards. Start with transparency.

—

The outcomes:
- 100% adoption across all new projects
- 75% reduction in onboarding time
- 98% acceptance on auto-generated output
- But the real win? Teams freed up to do human-centered work

That's the transformation.

## Key Quotes for Promotion

**For LinkedIn/Twitter:**
- "Designing for agents isn't like designing for chatbots. Agents are proactive, autonomous, and make decisions with consequences."

- "Trust is built through transparency first, capability clarity second, control assurance third. Most people build backwards."

- "We didn't just automate work. We freed up cognitive space for the strategic, human-centered work that actually drives project success."

- "Instead of filtering beans on spreadsheets, we can be developing deeper relationships and better understanding our customers."

- "The story isn't 'we have a tool that makes it cheaper.' The story is 'we can now tell you exactly what it will cost and deliver it with confidence.'"

## Questions to Consider Before Publishing

1. **Are there any confidential details I should remove?**
   - Client names (use anonymized references if needed)
   - Internal metrics (round to broader ranges if needed)
   - Strategic roadmap (keep at current level of detail)

2. **Do I want to include the transcripts or internal materials?**
   - Recommended: No. This should stand alone as your interpretation
   - Your insights are the value

3. **Should I reach out to Everett/Jennifer for feedback?**
   - Recommended: Yes. Quick review by leadership
   - Shows collaboration, gets their buy-in for promotion

4. **Am I comfortable with the thought leadership position?**
   - This establishes you as THE design voice for agentic AI at Orium
   - Is that the positioning you want?

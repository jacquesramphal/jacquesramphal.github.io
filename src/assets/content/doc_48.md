# Object Thinking vs. Spaghetti Thinking

#### Modular systems create scalable quality

There are two ways to approach quality.

One is holistic inspection: review everything at the end and hope cohesion emerges.

The other is component thinking: validate at the level of building blocks.

When systems are modular and reusable, quality scales.
When systems are tangled and monolithic, quality depends on memory and vigilance.

This applies beyond code.

Design systems.
Interaction patterns.
Acceptance criteria.
Decision frameworks.

Reusable thinking creates reusable quality.

Spaghetti thinking creates fragile products.

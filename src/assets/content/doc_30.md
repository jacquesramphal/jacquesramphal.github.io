# Ask Me Anything

#### I’m Jacques, a Senior Product Designer and design lead based in Toronto. I work at the intersection of design systems, code, and AI—designing experiences that actually ship.

## About Me

<details>
<summary>What kind of work do you actually do day to day?</summary>

I lead design on projects where systems, code, and AI all have to line up.  
That usually looks like:

* Architecting token-based design systems and component libraries for enterprise teams  
* Pairing with engineers to make sure design decisions survive implementation  
* Designing UX patterns for Genie, our AI/AX platform for agentic experiences  
* Coaching designers who want to move closer to code or systems work  

Most of my time is spent making sure the things we design are things we can reliably ship.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How would you describe your design philosophy?</summary>

I believe the future of digital products is **systems + teams**, not just screens.  

Design systems are organizational infrastructure. Good systems:

* Reduce design-to-dev friction  
* Make it easier to do the right thing than the wrong thing  
* Give teams shared language for decisions  

At the same time, I’m not interested in systems for their own sake. The point is to free people up—to spend less time on repetitive work and more time on novel problems, deeper discovery, and better decision-making.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Where does AI fit into your work?</summary>

Through Genie, I’m focused on **agentic UX**—how people collaborate with AI agents that can act on their behalf.  

That work includes:

* Designing how capabilities are surfaced so people know what an agent can do  
* Making reasoning and confidence visible so people know when to trust outputs  
* Balancing autonomy and control so it’s always clear who’s in charge  

I’m less interested in AI as a “wow” moment and more interested in how it quietly reshapes the work teams do every day.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How does code show up in your design practice?</summary>

I still write a fair amount of front-end code. That means:

* Building components in React/Vue that match the system exactly  
* Prototyping interaction patterns directly in code when Figma isn’t enough  
* Pairing with engineers on architecture decisions that affect UX  

Coding keeps me honest. It’s hard to design impossible things when you regularly implement them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you like to work with teams?</summary>

I try to make collaboration feel calm and clear rather than chaotic and reactive.  

Practically, that looks like:

* Clear expectations around design quality and handoff  
* Shared rituals (crits, audits, retros) that actually lead to change  
* Mindfulness and emotional intelligence as real tools for better work, not side projects  

I’m happiest when teams feel proud of what they ship—and not burned out getting there.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of opportunities are you most excited about?</summary>

I’m especially interested in work that sits at the overlap of:

* **Design systems architecture** for complex products  
* **AI/AX design** for agentic or autonomous systems  
* **Design-dev integration** where designers and engineers genuinely share ownership  

If a problem requires both systems thinking and hands-on building, I’m probably interested.

## Design Process (For the interviewers)

<span>
<details>
<summary>What does your end-to-end process look like?</summary>

I adjust process to context, but a typical arc looks like:

- Clarify the problem and success criteria with stakeholders  
- Map the existing system (users, data flows, constraints)  
- Explore options quickly in low fidelity  
- Align on a direction through critique and feasibility conversations  
- Move into higher-fidelity flows, systems, and component definitions  
- Partner with engineering on implementation, QA, and polish  

Throughout, I try to keep one eye on the immediate release and one eye on the system we’re evolving.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What tools do you actually use today?</summary>

My core stack right now:

- **Figma** for design systems, flows, and collaboration  
- **VS Code + Git** for front-end work and experiments  
- **Storybook** for documenting and testing components  
- **n8n / agent frameworks / LLM tooling** for Genie and other AI workflows  

I reach for other tools when they’re the right fit, but those are my daily drivers.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you handle feedback and disagreement?</summary>

I try to treat feedback as data, not a verdict.

- First, I clarify what the feedback is solving for (user outcome, business risk, technical constraint)  
- Then I propose options: keep as-is with rationale, adjust the design, or change the scope  
- If we still disagree, I try to make the tradeoffs explicit and small enough to test  

I care a lot about strong opinions, loosely held—and a culture where critique feels safe and useful.

## Working Together

<span>
<details>
<summary>How do you like to collaborate with product and engineering?</summary>

Ideally, we’re co-owning outcomes, not throwing work over walls.

- With product, I like to collaborate on shaping problems and defining success early  
- With engineering, I prefer pairing on constraints, architecture choices, and edge cases before we over-invest in polish  

I’ve found the best work happens when everyone feels they had a hand in the outcome—and understands why the decisions were made.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do you care about outside of the work itself?</summary>

I care a lot about how teams feel while doing the work:

- Psychological safety in critique and experimentation  
- Mindfulness and emotional intelligence as practical tools, not afterthoughts  
- Sustainable pacing—so people can have long, creative careers without burning out  

Those things aren’t separate from delivery quality; they’re a precondition for it.

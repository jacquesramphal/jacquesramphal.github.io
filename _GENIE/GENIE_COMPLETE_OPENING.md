## What is Genie?

Before I tell you the story of building it, you need to understand what Genie actually is.

**Genie is an agentic orchestration layer for delivery operations.** It's a system that connects to your live project ecosystem—Jira, Slack, Mavenlink, your project databases—and continuously synthesizes context, surfaces insights, and automates workflows without requiring manual intervention.

Think of it this way: **Genie is what happens when you give an agent access to all your operational data and the ability to take action.**

At its core, Genie does four things:

1. **Consolidates Context** — It pulls information from 10+ systems and maintains persistent awareness of project state. Instead of fragmented data across tools, there's one unified understanding of where things stand.

2. **Generates Requirements** — It draws from your historical project data and patterns to auto-generate backlogs, requirements, and scope documents. Instead of building from scratch every time, it learns from what you've done before.

3. **Surfaces Risks** — It identifies emerging problems before they become catastrophic. It generates daily alerts and weekly executive summaries, surfacing the signal among the noise.

4. **Automates Workflows** — It takes action: creates tickets, sends reminders, generates presentation decks, publishes updates. It handles the busywork so humans can focus on decisions.

Most importantly: **Genie maintains transparency about what it's doing and why.** Every output shows sources, reasoning, and confidence levels. It's not a black box. It's a trustworthy collaborator.

## The Origin: Multiply Impact With Less

Now, why did I build this?

Our team had shrunk. The industry was in transition. We needed to deliver more with fewer resources. And I felt the pressure personally: I was wearing multiple hats, and I wasn't going to be able to give more of myself just by working longer hours.

**The challenge wasn't to do more by exhausting myself. The challenge was to multiply my impact.**

That's the constraint that drove Genie. Not "I'm bored" or "I have a side project idea." The real constraint was: **How do I give more while protecting my own capacity?**

I started thinking: What if there was a system that could do the repetitive, mechanical work? What if I could automate the setup phase of every project? What if I could compress three days of manual work into three hours of verification?

Not to cut costs. To multiply impact. To do more strategic work. To give more of myself to problems that actually needed me.

That's Genie. It's a multiplier. It's leverage.

### The Personal Problem

I was wearing multiple hats at Orium: leading design systems, shipping client work, mentoring designers, trying to maintain quality across 50+ concurrent projects.

At the start of every project, the same work repeated:
- Synthesizing information from 10 different sources (sales notes, scope docs, design files, Slack conversations, interview transcripts)
- Building requirements from scratch, even though we'd done similar projects hundreds of times
- Manually flagging risks I'd seen before in other engagements
- Creating backlogs that took days to build and often missed context

**That repetitive work wasn't strategic. It wasn't where my thinking was needed.**

If I could automate that phase—compress it, standardize it, let a system handle it—I could multiply what I contributed to projects that actually needed my design thinking, my judgment, my strategy.

That's when I started experimenting.

### The Spark: A Personal Experiment

I wasn't thinking about building a company product. I was thinking about automating the busywork so I could do the work that mattered.

I started experimenting on late afternoons—30 minutes between design reviews here, an hour on Friday evening there. Nothing fancy. Small automations. Custom GPTs. Scripts that could summarize meetings or draft Jira tickets.

This was when I started learning AI development in earnest. Not theoretically. Practically. I had to **understand** how agents work because I was building one to multiply my own impact.

That forced me to learn n8n deeply. To understand workflow orchestration. To think about agents not as a cool tech concept but as a system that had to handle real data, real decisions, real consequences.

It was a passion project. It was also an education.

### From Personal Multiplier to Organizational Capability

Then something unexpected happened: **everyone wanted it.**

I showed my quick experiments to the team, and people started asking: "Can Genie do this? Can it help with that?"

I realized my problem wasn't unique. Every project lead was drowning in setup work. Every designer was fighting information fragmentation. Every delivery manager was manually tracking risks they'd seen before.

**My personal multiplier could become an organizational multiplier.**

That's when it got interesting. Building Genie for just me was one challenge. Scaling it to work for an entire team? That required me to become something new.

I had to become a product manager. Not in the traditional sense—I wasn't in strategy meetings. I was in the trenches, shipping features, gathering feedback, making tradeoffs. Learning product thinking by doing.

I had to learn how to lead without full authority. How to champion a vision while remaining a high-performing individual contributor. How to serve my team's needs while protecting my own growth. How to work with key collaborators (Everett, Jennifer) and distribute the load of building something this complex.

When I brought the experiments to leadership, Everett saw what I was figuring out: this could transform our entire delivery model.

I pitched the vision: **a supervisor agent with access to live organizational data, capable of orchestrating multiple specialist sub-agents, synthesizing context in real-time, and triggering automated workflows across our entire delivery infrastructure.**

But building that vision meant I had to go deep on things I didn't fully understand. Unfamiliar territory. Complex integration challenges. Technical decisions that affected how teams worked.

I learned to ask: When do I dig deep? When do I step back? When do I admit I don't know and seek help?

Building Genie at scale—often as a one-person show supported by collaborators—taught me that **the best builders are comfortable with not knowing everything.**

They know when to get deep on hard problems. And they know when to step back and say: "This is bigger than my current expertise. Let's think about this differently."

That's what happened. From personal multiplier to organizational platform, I wasn't just building a product. **I was rebuilding my own skillset.**

I became an AI developer. A workflow orchestration expert. A product thinker. A leader who codes. Someone who understands the intersection of design, development, and AI in a way I couldn't have if I'd stayed in my lane.

**That's the real story of Genie.**

It's not just what I built. It's what building it made me. And more importantly, it's what it enabled us to do as a team.

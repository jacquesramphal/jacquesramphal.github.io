# Baselines Over Heroics

## Building sustainable quality through strong foundations

Many teams rely on hero designers and sharp engineers to "catch things."

That doesn't scale.

The alternative is a strong baseline.

A baseline is a shared starting point that encodes standards:

* Accessibility.
* Interaction patterns.
* Visual consistency.
* Spacing logic.
* System behaviors.

When your baseline is weak, quality depends on memory and vigilance.
When your baseline is strong, quality becomes automatic.

Heroics are exciting.
Baselines are sustainable.

Mature teams invest less in chasing errors and more in designing systems that make errors harder to produce.

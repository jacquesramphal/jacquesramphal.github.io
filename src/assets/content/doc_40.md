## Simple and Transparent


This portfolio site respects your privacy. Here's what you should know:

## What I Collect

**Nothing Personal**
This site doesn't collect, store, or process personal information. No accounts, no login, no data collection.

**Analytics**
Basic website analytics may be used to understand traffic patterns (page views, referral sources). This is aggregated, anonymized data that doesn't identify individuals.

**Local Storage**
Your theme preference (light/dark mode) is stored locally in your browser to remember your choice. This data never leaves your device.

## What I Don't Do

- No tracking across websites
- No selling of data (there's no data to sell)
- No advertising networks
- No third-party data sharing
- No cookies for tracking purposes

## AI Chatbot

If you interact with the AI chatbot:
- Conversations are processed to provide responses
- No conversation history is permanently stored
- No personal information is required to use the chatbot
- Interactions are used solely to improve the experience

## Third-Party Services

**Netlify (Hosting)**
This site is hosted on Netlify. Their privacy policy applies to hosting services.

**GitHub (Source Control)**
Source code is stored on GitHub, but no user data from the site is transmitted there.

## Your Control

**Theme Preference**
Clear your browser's local storage to reset your theme preference.

**Opt Out**
Use browser settings or extensions to block analytics if desired. The site functions fully without them.

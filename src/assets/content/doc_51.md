# The Designer in the Age of AI

#### Shifting from inspectors to system stewards

AI can review.
AI can compare.
AI can suggest.

But AI cannot care.

The role of the designer isn't shrinking. It's sharpening.

As tools automate comparison and regression, designers shift from inspectors to orchestrators:

* Defining the baseline.
* Setting the standards.
* Interpreting nuance.
* Balancing trade-offs.
* Protecting coherence across systems.

In a world where machines can generate interfaces, the differentiator is not output — it's intention.

Designers are not becoming obsolete.

We are becoming system stewards.

# Accessibility

## Designed for Everyone


This site is built with accessibility in mind. While no site is perfect, I'm committed to making this portfolio usable by as many people as possible.

## Current Features

**Semantic HTML**
Proper heading hierarchy, landmark regions, and semantic elements ensure screen readers can navigate effectively.

**Keyboard Navigation**
All interactive elements are keyboard accessible. Tab through the site, use Enter/Space to activate, and Escape to close modals.

**Theme Options**
Light and dark themes with system preference detection help reduce eye strain and accommodate different viewing preferences.

**Readable Typography**
- Minimum 16px base font size
- Sufficient line height for readability
- High contrast text on backgrounds
- Variable font tuned for legibility

**Focus Indicators**
Clear focus states on interactive elements make keyboard navigation visible and predictable.

**Responsive Design**
Content adapts to different screen sizes, zoom levels, and device types without breaking layout or losing functionality.

## Ongoing Improvements

Accessibility is a continuous practice. I'm working on:
- Enhanced ARIA labels and descriptions
- Improved color contrast in all themes
- Better image alt text
- Skip navigation links
- Reduced motion preferences

## Known Limitations

- Some decorative animations may not respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Color contrast could be improved in certain theme combinations
- Alt text on portfolio images is still being refined

## Feedback Welcome

If you encounter accessibility barriers, please let me know. I want to make this site better for everyone.

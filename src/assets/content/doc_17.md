### A Strategic Shift in Quality Assurance
In 2023 I began a crusade to evanglize Design QA at Orium. This isn't just a change in terminology—it's a fundamental shift in how we approach the bridge between design and development. So, why the new focus? DQA is about more than catching bugs; it's about ensuring our designs not only look good but function beautifully right from the start.

### The Genesis of DQA
Traditionally, the journey from concept to product involves several stops—Code Review (CR) and Quality Assurance (QA) being notable ones. However, something was missing: a dedicated focus on design. DQA fills this gap. It's our proactive measure to address visual and usability concerns before they become expensive, time-consuming issues. By integrating a specific DQA phase in tools like Jira, we've made design a central pillar of our project checkpoints.
This early focus helps in several ways:
- Reduces Revisions: By catching potential design issues early, we cut down on the need for revisions later in the development process
- Enhances Collaboration: DQA fosters a closer collaboration between designers and developers, ensuring the final product is both functional and visually appealing.

### Evolution and Semantics of Design Quality Assurance (DQA)
The conversation around quality in design has evolved. The inclusion of "QA" in DQA highlights its essential role in the broader Quality Assurance framework. It highlights that DQA is not an isolated task but a fundamental component of our overall quality assurance strategy. 

Previously, our terminology inadvertently created a divide between our specialized QA activities and the broader Quality Assurance framework. Those included:

- **Visual Quality Control (vQC)**: This focuses primarily on ensuring that all visual aspects of our products meet high standards of aesthetics and functionality
- **Interaction Quality Control (XQC)**: This addresses how users interact with the product, aiming to optimize usability and user experience

By explicitly referring to it as part of QA, we prevent any inadvertent separation from other quality control processes. Naming it Design Quality Assurance reinforces its significance and the releationship it shares with all other QA dimensions, reminding everyone that both DQA and Functional QA are integral to delivering a high-quality product.

This thorough approach ensures that every aspect—from pixel-perfect visuals to intuitive user interactions—is meticulously crafted and assessed. This not only elevates the quality of our products but also reaffirms the integral role of DQA within our overall Quality Assurance strategy, bridging any gaps that previously existed and highlighting the interconnectedness of all QA activities.

### Distinguishing DQA from Functional QA
Understanding the distinction between Design QA (DQA) and Functional QA is crucial. While Functional QA delves deep into the product's operations, testing its interactions and features, Design QA focuses sharply on the aesthetics and user experience. Here's what each entails:

- **Design QA**: Ensures that every visual element is meticulously crafted, and the overall user experience is smooth and seamless
- **Functional QA**: Checks the functionality of the product to guarantee it operates flawlessly and meets all specified requirements without any glitches.

This deliberate separation, while maintaining the QA aspect of both activities, enables our teams to specialize and hone their focus, significantly enhancing the quality of the final product. Additionally, it serves as a constant reminder of how both elements are interconnected and equally crucial to our quality strategy.


### What Does Design Quality Assurance Really Mean?
DQA goes beyond mere aesthetics. It's an exhaustive quality check that spans everything from how the design looks to how it behaves across different platforms and devices. Here’s what it involves:
- Testing Across Devices: Ensuring the design stands up to the demands of diverse hardware
- Collaborative Revisions: Using tools to bridge any gaps between design intent and technical execution, with room for feedback and iteration

Ultimately, DQA ensures that the final product isn’t just functional but also delights users visually and interactively.

### Integrating DQA Within the QA Framework
The inclusion of "QA" in DQA reminds us of its integral role in the broader Quality Assurance process. It emphasizes that DQA is not a separate endeavor but a partner in the overall quality strategy. Previously, not referring to it as part of QA might have inadvertently isolated it from other quality control activities, but by naming it Design Quality Assurance, we reinforce its importance and interconnectedness with all QA dimensions.

### Conclusion: Why DQA Matters
Adopting Design Quality Assurance isn't just about adhering to standards—it's about setting new ones. As we refine our approach, the benefits are clear: fewer backtracks, a smoother workflow, and a product that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. DQA isn’t just a process; it’s a commitment to excellence and an essential step toward creating products that are not only effective but also exceptional.

      "description": "Why a shared design language is the most resilient investment teams can make as tools, roles, and workflows keep evolving. In a time when everything else in tech feels like shifting sand, design tokens are the bedrock—tiny pieces of your design's DNA that become a shared language everyone can speak, ensuring consistency and adaptability even as the design tools around them evolve.",

      "description": "Designing agentic systems forces you to rethink how work gets done. Not in the abstract, but in the day-to-day reality of delivery: shifting requirements, scattered context, rising risk, and teams stretched thin. This article explores how we built Genie—an agentic orchestration layer that consolidates context, generates requirements, surfaces risks, and automates workflows—and the three mental model problems we solved in designing for agentic AI.",

The designer of today is a strategic thinker, a problem solver, and a storyteller. The designer of today is a leader, a collaborator, and a change agent. The designer of today is a business person, a technologist, and a futurist.",

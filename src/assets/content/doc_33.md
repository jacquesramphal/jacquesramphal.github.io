## What is Genie?

Genie is an **agentic orchestration layer for delivery operations**. It connects to Jira, Slack, Mavenlink, and your project ecosystem, synthesizing context and automating workflows in real time.

Think of Genie as **an operational intelligence** that continuously understands your project state and takes action when needed.

Genie does four things:

1. **Consolidates Context** — Creates a unified, always-current understanding of project health.  
2. **Generates Requirements** — Learns from past engagements to produce backlogs, scope docs, and requirements.  
3. **Surfaces Risks** — Identifies emerging issues early and provides daily alerts and weekly summaries.  
4. **Automates Workflows** — Creates tickets, drafts documents, and handles operational busywork transparently.

Every output includes sources, reasoning, and confidence. **It’s a collaborator, not a black box.**

## The Origin: Reclaim Creative Focus

Our team was smaller. Workloads were heavier. I was spending too much time on predictable design tasks instead of creative problem-solving.

I wasn’t trying to build a product—I was trying to reclaim time.

### The Personal Problem

My role spanned:

- Managing design systems  
- Running audits and quality checks  
- Generating requirements  
- Mapping components  
- Ensuring front-end design fidelity  

All important. All repetitive. And all things I knew could be partially automated.

The real issue: **every project required the same manual synthesis across scattered sources.** The repetition drained creative energy that should have gone to solving user problems.

### The Spark: A Personal Experiment

I started automating small tasks—user story drafting, audit scripts, component mapping—usually between meetings. These experiments forced me to learn n8n, agent frameworks, and workflow orchestration through real problems, not theory.

I wasn’t building “AI tools.” I was building **ways to eliminate routine** so I could focus on design judgment.

### From Personal Reclamation to Organizational Capability

Once I shared the early experiments, interest spread quickly. Designers, PMs, DMs—everyone saw their own repetitive patterns.

My personal fix became a team-wide opportunity: **create a system that gives designers more time for actual design.**

To scale it, I had to stretch into product thinking—prioritizing features, gathering feedback, and defining a path that supported the team’s real needs. Leadership saw the potential: make projects more strategic and less mechanical.

That journey reshaped me. I became a designer who builds agents, orchestrates workflows, and bridges design, development, and AI—without losing the heart of my craft.

## The Problem: Designing an Interface That Doesn’t Feel Like an Interface

Agentic systems don’t behave like apps or chatbots. They’re proactive, autonomous, and operate across multiple systems—often without a visible interface.

This wasn’t a UI problem. It was a **mental model problem**.

We needed new patterns for how humans understand and collaborate with an AI that can act on its own.

## The Design Challenge: Three Mental Model Problems

### 1. Capability Exposition  
**“What can Genie do, and when should I use it?”**

People weren’t sure what to ask. Capabilities were powerful but invisible. If users don’t understand an agent’s strengths, they default to manual work.

The design task: **surface capability at the moment of need**, not in documentation.

### 2. Trust & Transparency  
**“Should I believe this output?”**

Genie produces risks, backlogs, and summaries that guide real decisions. Trust requires clarity: what data did it use, how did it reason, and how confident is it?

We designed every output to expose its logic. Not perfection—**verifiable reasoning**.

### 3. Autonomy vs. Control  
**“Who’s in charge right now?”**

Genie answers questions, recommends actions, and sometimes acts autonomously. Without clear signals, users could confuse automated steps with approved decisions.

The design principle: **absolute clarity about agency**—when Genie acts, when it suggests, and when humans decide.

## The Outcomes: What We Learned About Agentic UX

### The Real Outcome: Freeing People to Do Human Work

The biggest impact isn’t speed—it’s **focus**.

Project leads now start with synthesized context, automated artifacts, and clear risks. Time once spent on setup is now spent on discovery, client alignment, and strategy.

This shift enables more predictable delivery and stronger partnerships. With less cognitive load on logistics, teams engage more deeply with client needs.

### What We’re Seeing

- Higher trust in generated outputs  
- Fewer late-stage surprises  
- Smoother alignment between teams  
- More time for strategic, human-centered work  

Genie doesn’t replace expertise. It **amplifies** it.

## Key Takeaways: Building a Product, Rebuilding Yourself

### 1. Growth Comes From Solving Real Problems  
Hands-on challenges teach faster than courses ever will.

### 2. You Can Lead While Staying Close to the Work  
IC leadership works when you stay grounded in real workflows.

### 3. Know When to Go Deep, When to Step Back  
Scaling a system requires both precision and humility.

### 4. Build for the Team, Not Just Yourself  
Usefulness comes from listening, not just inventing.

### 5. Building Products Changes You  
You learn new disciplines by doing, shipping, and iterating.

## The Real Challenge: Building For Others

Adoption isn’t about capability—it’s about people’s energy and fears.

Teams are stretched. New tools require effort. Concerns about AI aren’t resistance—they’re human.

I’m learning patience. Adoption comes from empathy, not pressure. Building for the org means understanding real barriers: fatigue, trust, change saturation.

Genie began as a personal tool. Now it’s becoming a shared platform, shaped by feedback, collaboration, and iteration.

The journey is messy. Some days feel like breakthroughs; others require resilience. But the long-term impact—time reclaimed, clarity gained, trust built—is worth it.

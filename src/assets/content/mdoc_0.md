The best QA Process is one that doesn’t have to happen

## **Chapter 1: Introduction to Design Quality Assurance**

### 1.1 What is Design Quality Assurance?

_Design Quality Assurance (DQA)_ is the process of reviewing and testing a design project to ensure that it meets certain standards and specifications. This includes checking for consistency, accuracy, and usability across different platforms, devices, and browsers. The aim of DQA is to identify and resolve any issues or errors in the design before it is released to the public. DQA is a crucial step in the design process to ensure that the final product meets the client's requirements, meets the user's needs, and is of high quality.

### 1.2 Key Terminology in Design QA

DQA is the preferred choice for comprehensive quality assurance of design over other options like vQC, vQA, and XQC. While vQC (Visual Quality Control) and vQA (Visual Quality Assurance) focus primarily on visual aspects, DQA encompasses a broader range of design-related considerations.

DQA goes beyond visual elements and ensures that the design meets specified standards, functional requirements, and user expectations. It encompasses aspects like usability, functionality, and user experience, providing a more holistic approach to quality assurance. By using DQA, you can ensure end-to-end assessment and validation of the design, covering visual aspects as well as other crucial factors that impact the overall quality of the design.

### 1.3 Understanding the Designer's Role in QA

As designers, it is our responsibility to define and advocate for a product's visual language and user experience. Collaboration tools can help bridge the gap between design and development, but Design Quality Assurance (DQA) is still an important step in every project's lifecycle. Here are some tips and takeaways to ensure proper fit and finish at the end of a project:

- Identify and review key screens first, then work through subpages.
    
- Develop a Component Library with your team and maintain it so that developers have a source of truth.
    
- Confirm mobile-first vs. desktop-only engagement and the breakpoints that have been accommodated for.
    
- Document interactions and animations, get access to a testing environment, confirm intended interactions, and establish a workflow for approving DQA fixes in the browser.
    
- Provide visual cross-references and group DQA stories around components.
    
- Confirm required browsers and test on as many devices as possible within your given timeframe.
    
- Limit your review to primary screens and global elements and define what constitutes "done".
    

While it may not be possible to ensure that every detail is perfect based on constraints, designing with the end user in mind and considering the implications of design choices across devices and browsers is essential.

### 1.4 Object-oriented vs. Holistic QA Approaches

_Object-oriented design QA_ refers to a testing approach that focuses on defining and testing components rather than the system or application. In this approach, designers and QA’s break down the application into smaller components and test each component based on its visual presentation and functionality.

_Non-object-oriented of Holistic QA_ refers to a testing approach that tests the entire system or application as a whole. In this approach, testers focus on the entire system, including its design, functionality, usability, and performance.

At the start of a project, it's recommended to focus on quality assurance (QA) at the component level. This helps to maintain the ability to reuse components and reduces the chances of errors during implementation. Overall, both approaches have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of which approach to use depends on the specific needs of the project and the goals of the testing process.

- Larger teams may have the capacity for parallel UI testing and simultaneous Cross-Browser/Device Testing in the Development/Deployment phase.
    
- Larger teams with dedicated accessibility experts can efficiently conduct Accessibility Testing and address any issues promptly during the Testing/Quality Assurance phase.
    
- Larger teams can dedicate resources to streamline documentation and reporting in the Review/Retrospective phase, reducing the time required.
    

*Note: The time percentages represent the estimated allocation of time for each phase. The total percentage

### 2.3 Design Support Scenarios

Here are some different examples of levels of design support:

#### **Version 1**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Level of Design Support**|**Description**|
|No Design Support|The project does not involve any design work, and design decisions are not a consideration.|
|Limited Design Support|The project includes some design work, but it is limited in scope or importance. Design decisions may be made by non-designers, or the project may not have a dedicated designer.|
|Moderate Design Support|The project includes a significant amount of design work, and design decisions are an important consideration. The project may have a dedicated designer or design team, and design decisions are made collaboratively with other stakeholders.|
|High Design Support|The project is heavily focused on design, and design decisions have a significant impact on the project's success. The project has a dedicated design team, and design decisions are made collaboratively with other stakeholders. Design is seen as a key differentiator for the project.|

It's important to note that the level of design support needed for a project will depend on various factors such as the complexity of the project, budget, timeline, and the overall importance of design in achieving project goals.

### Toolkit Overview

#### Leveraging Figma for Effective Quality Assurance

Figma is an 'all-in-one' design platform that provides powerful collaborative features for design teams. Here are some important plugins and tools that enhance Quality Assurance (QA) in Figma:

- [Storybook Connect Figma Plugin](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma")
    
- [Tokens Studio for Figma (Figma Tokens)](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens) "https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens)")
    

#### Utilizing Storybook for Design Consistency

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It helps ensure design consistency and allows for efficient QA. Consider using the following plugins:

- Storybook [design addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs "https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs")
    
- Chromatic Plugin (Storybook maintained)
    

#### Harnessing StyleDictionary for Design System Maintenance

[StyleDictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/ "https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/") is a build system that allows you to define styles once, in a way for any platform or language to consume. It serves as a centralized place to create and edit styles, and a single command exports these rules to all the places you need them. This enhances the efficiency of Design System maintenance and QA.

### 3.5 Demo

At the time of writing this, Tokens Studio for Figma and StyleDictionary were the primary tools for managing tokens and syncing with GitHub. However, with the introduction of Variables and the possibility of GitHub integration becoming native to Figma in the future, these tools might become redundant soon.

- Improves collaboration and accountability within design and development teams.
    
- Enables smooth collaboration between designers and QA testers.
    
- Facilitates prompt identification and resolution of issues, leading to a more efficient QA workflow.
    

#### Current Challenges

Currently, design tracking faces some obstacles in the development process:

1. **Lack of Documentation**: Design approvals and potential scope changes are not adequately documented.
    
2. **Incomplete Velocity**: Design tasks are not considered during estimation sessions, affecting project velocity.
    
3. **Unclear Sprint Goals**: Bug tickets related to design are not accounted for in the Definition of Done for sprint goals.
    
4. **Insufficient Requirement Capture**: The approval process for design tickets is not properly tracked, leading to potential requirement capture issues.
    

#### Proposed Solutions

To address these challenges, the following solutions are recommended:

1. **Document Design Tickets**: Include design tickets in the same backlog as development to link design references to corresponding tickets, ensuring better documentation and traceability.
    
2. **Estimation Sessions**: Design tasks should be considered in estimation sessions to contribute to project velocity and better planning.
    
3. **Incorporate Bug Tickets**: Account for bug tickets related to design in the Definition of Done for sprint goals, ensuring a more comprehensive QA process.
    
4. **Track Approval Process**: Implement a process to track the approval process for design tickets and document any changes to capture requirements accurately.
    
5. **Jira Ticket References**: Attach and reference design tickets in Jira tickets or use Figma Embeds to maintain a clear connection between design work and development tasks.
    
6. **Maintain Figma Version Control**: Ensure proper version control is maintained in Figma to avoid confusion and ensure that the latest designs are being reviewed and implemented.
    

#### Considerations for DQA Ticket Handling

The team should consider the following factors when deciding how to handle DQA tickets:

- Treating each DQA issue as an individual ticket allows for better tracking and management, providing clear visibility into the status and resolution of design-related feedback and defects.
    
- Depending on the team's preference and established workflow, DQA bugs can be handled as part of the feature ticket or in separate dedicated Jira tickets.
    
- Separating DQA issues into their own tickets can be beneficial for documentation purposes, providing a clear record of design-related feedback and defects.
    

#### Best Practices

To effectively manage DQA tickets, the team should follow these best practices:

- Group DQA tickets by component or page to organize related issues efficiently.
    
- Estimate each DQA ticket, with typical estimates falling in the range of 0 to 1 story points.
    
- The Project Manager plays a crucial role in grooming the list of DQA tickets, considering options like combining related tickets or creating epics for better organization.
    
- Pre-groom the backlog before sprint planning, and collectively provide formal estimates during the planning session for "consolidated" DQA tickets to include them in the sprint accordingly.
    

By following these considerations and best practices, teams can effectively leverage DQA in Jira, enhancing collaboration, improving design quality, and delivering high-quality products within their development sprints. The well-structured process and workflow ensure efficient handling of DQA tickets, reducing potential setbacks and optimizing the development cycle.

## 4.2 Integrating DQA in Jira for Seamless Collaboration

### Overview

This section emphasizes the importance of integrating Design Quality Assurance (DQA) into the Jira workflow from the beginning. DQA should be a part of the Definition of Done (DoD) to enhance efficiency and collaboration within Jira projects with design support.

![](blob:https://myplanet.jira.com/7c0e4c67-eee4-4aa5-9d98-7f6cc7095e24#media-blob-url=true&id=e26fb611-ba5c-4f28-bf61-80b8778b0e19&collection=contentId-296812551&contextId=296812551&height=362&width=1448&alt=)

_DQA is part of the Definition of Done (DoD). Embedded in our Jira workflow._

### **Objective**

The aim of DQA is not to hinder productivity but to streamline it by promoting cooperation between developers and designers before advancing tickets to Code Review (CR) and Quality Assurance (QA). This process helps to address visual issues early on, reducing the likelihood of tickets being pushed back later in the development cycle.

#### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Development Phase**
    
    - Developers complete their coding work for the feature or task.
        
2. **DQA Phase**
    
    - After development, developers move the ticket to the DQA column in the Jira workflow.
        
3. **Collaboration**
    
    - Developers and designers collaborate closely to conduct a quick review of the ticket.
        
    - The designer examines the ticket and provides feedback on any design-related issues.
        
4. **QA Notes and Visuals**
    
    - Quality Assurance notes are attached to the ticket in Jira to document findings.
        
    - If necessary, supporting visuals can be provided along with the QA notes.
        
5. **Designer Approval**
    
    - Once the designer approves the ticket after addressing any issues, it can proceed to the code review stage.
        

By following this step-by-step process and integrating DQA into the Jira workflow, teams can ensure seamless collaboration between developers and designers, improve the quality of the deliverables, and minimize potential setbacks later in the development cycle. This streamlined approach helps in creating a more efficient and productive development process.

---

### 4.4 Levels of Design Support

The DQA column should not be a stagnant blockage, and designers should be updated on any movement of tickets in this column, allowing them time to provide feedback to ensure sustainable progress. Furthermore, automated alerts can be set up to update concerned parties when tickets move to specific columns.

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Level of Design Support**|**Description**|**Workflow**|
|No design support|No design resources allocated to the project|TBD|
|Minimal design support|Design resources allocated to the project, but limited to providing basic wireframes and mockups||
|Moderate design support|Design resources allocated to the project, providing full UI/UX design and collaborating with developers||
|High design support|Design resources allocated to the project, providing full UI/UX design, collaborating with developers, and conducting user testing||

It's important to note that the level of design support needed for a project will depend on various factors such as the complexity of the project, budget, timeline, and the overall importance of design in achieving project goals.

Typically we dont account for DQA in our DoD. Visual polish is part of a ticket's acceptance criteria. This means when estimating, we may need to take on less tickets per sprint, but as a result we will deliver more complete tickets each sprint, lessening the need to revisit and refactor tickets during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) sprints later in the project. Sometimes due to timelines, we never get to this step. This significantly impacts the quality of the work we deliver.

To Add:

- With regards to the flow, will _all_ tickets need to go through DQA before hitting “Code Review”?
    
    - only those with a visual component. Backend and strictly functional tickets would bypass that phase. There is a check that comes up when moving tickets through QA. Something like this could be triggered when moving an item OUT of DQA to check “does this ticket have a visual component? If yes, has it been reviewed and approved? If no then move to CR” etc.

### 4.5 Establishing Baseline with Figma & Storybook

Reading: [https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/208470116](https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/208470116)

Designers and developers should have a shared understanding of components and features to work closely together. Figma and Storybook offer controls and previews for coded components and a shared view of design and development environments. Connect to a main or development branch to access the latest component states from Figma.

In order to link Figma and Storybook, you need to:

- Have access to React repository with Storybook and Chromatic installed. See [this Chromatic Install guide.](https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/296812551/Design+Quality+Assurance+%28DQA%29+Handbook#Using-Storybook-Chromatic-to-manage-and-review-changes "https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/296812551/Design+Quality+Assurance+%28DQA%29+Handbook#Using-Storybook-Chromatic-to-manage-and-review-changes")
    
- Link stories to designs using the [Storybook Connect Figma Plugin](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma").
    
- Embed Figma in Storybook with the [design addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs "https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-designs").
    

This approach relies on an Object-oriented approach to visual QA, focusing on testing individual components.

#### 4.6.1 Add Storybook stories in Figma

The Figma [Storybook Connect Figma Plugin](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma "https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045003494-Storybook-and-Figma") allows you to embed component stories in Figma, allowing you to cross-reference the live implementation from Storybook in your Figma file. The plugin is powered by [Storybook embeds](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/embed#embed-stories-on-other-platforms "https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/embed#embed-stories-on-other-platforms") and [Chromatic](https://chromatic.com/docs/figma "https://chromatic.com/docs/figma"), a publishing tool created by the Storybook team.

To connect Storybook to Figma follow the steps below:

1. Add the [Storybook Connect Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect "https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1056265616080331589/Storybook-Connect") to Figma.
    
2. Create an account and sign in with [Chromatic](https://chromatic.com/docs/figma "https://chromatic.com/docs/figma"). Grab link from stories hosted on Chromatic. You can click the link to storybook (hosted on chromatic ie. a permalink tied to a build)
    
3. Run storybook/chromatic plugin from figma file and paste Chromatic link
    
4. Once connected to chromatic, storybook links are available in the Figma sidebar
    

> The connection travels with the component instance to other files. You can therefore see what code is associated with your component and the status of the styling/functionality 🔥

### 4.7 Project Startup & Continuous Integration with Design Tokens

DO VARIABLES MAKE THIS REDUNDANT?

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a12TuEaiSqc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a12TuEaiSqc) I guess it sounds like we still need to maintain both variables and studio tokens--at least until we can get a github connection natively

Would tokens show the name value in dev mode? Variables do, so if you have `space-02` it would show as `space-02` for the dev, and they could still see the pixel value if needed.

Beginner’s mind steps - can this be done by a novice with no git experience - SHOULD it

Things that require dev and designer…

The Figma tokens plugin allows designers to export foundational styles in a format usable in code with Style-Dictionary. Developers can use JSON values for StyleDictionary variables and apply styles to components. Designers can modify built components with variables and push changes directly to the Github tokens.json.

**Tools:** Figma, [Tokens Studio for Figma (Figma Tokens)](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens) "https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens)"), [Styledictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/ "https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/")

#### Current State

- Our Figma files have numerous styles.
    
- Updating these styles necessitates communicating with developers via Jira or other means.
    
- It is mandatory to go into the code base to apply updates.
    
- Designers need to perform quality assurance.
    

#### Solution

By utilizing Figma Tokens and Style Dictionary, we can easily define and oversee styles within the Figma platform. Moreover, we can connect to a Github repository containing coded components and seamlessly integrate changes from Figma, with minimal to no developer input. This is an incredibly exciting prospect!

#### Required Toolkit

- [Figma Tokens Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens) "https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Tokens-Studio-for-Figma-(Figma-Tokens)")
    
    - Free tier, see PRO features [https://tokens.studio/pricing](https://tokens.studio/pricing)
        
    - Composition (groups tokens, mixins)
        
    - Branch switching
        
    - Advanced Theming
        
- Github
    
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/ "https://code.visualstudio.com/")
    
- [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/ "https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/")
    

Consider exploring CMS integration with StyleDictionary for exchanging tokens between contentful, GitHub, and Figma.

### 4.8 Automated Visual Regression Testing for Efficient QA

Automated Visual Regression Testing ensures that new functionality or features added to an application do not impact its overall look and feel.

Read more: [What is Automated Regression Testing?](https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/296812551/Design+Quality+Assurance+%28DQA%29+Handbook#What-is-Automated-Regression-Testing%3F "https://myplanet.jira.com/wiki/spaces/DQA/pages/296812551/Design+Quality+Assurance+%28DQA%29+Handbook#What-is-Automated-Regression-Testing%3F")

Using the Chromatic plugin in Storybook can ensure efficient and quality integration between designers and developers. A review process is recommended to approve changes before merging and comparison overlays aid with identifying regressions. Alternatively, visual regression testing can be conducted with Virtuoso, which allows for testing automation and configurable alerts. Consult your team to determine the best tool for you project.

Investigation into visual regression testing with Figma's visual baselines is to come.

### 6.1 More Resources for Deepening DQA Knowledge

### 6.2 Understanding Automated Regression Testing

- Automated Visual Regression Testing ensures that new functionality or features added to an application do not impact its overall look and feel.
    
- Automated Visual Testing evaluates the visual appearance of an application under test by comparing it with known good screenshots to ensure that it correctly matches. This process evaluates Design Quality attributes such as color consistency, size, and alignment.
    
- Visual Testing is performed alongside Functional Testing to evaluate the Design Quality aspect of an application under test. This is difficult for Functional Automation Frameworks to capture due to their focus on functional aspects only.
    
- Software developers, QAs, and owners/managers of applications use these tests to ensure that their designs have not changed unexpectedly.
    

**Key Features:**

- Fast Performance
    
- Quick Integration with any DevOps or Test Frameworks
    
- Github Integration
    
- Jira Integration
    
- Team Collaboration
    
- Scalable
    
- Testing all in one place
    
    - Integrate existing Selenium or Cypress tests with SDK with a few lines of code to have all automation tests in one place - Functional + Visual
        

### 6.3 The Problem / Current State - Manual Testing

![](blob:https://myplanet.jira.com/58cd61aa-2d02-48c1-ba01-aca0c104a29a#media-blob-url=true&id=740e79da-a7c0-4161-8e9a-c58a35c5dd55&collection=contentId-296812551&contextId=296812551&height=495&width=1782&alt=)

Visual and UX testing as dedicated tasks

### 6.4 Challenges:

- **Complexity:** Automated testing can be complex and difficult to estimate in terms of effort required.
    
- **Workflow Integration:** When the automated testing workflow isn't integrated, it can consume large amounts of design and development time.
    
- **Developer Overload:** A staggered testing workflow can cause developer overload, especially under tight timelines.
    
- **Documentation and Communication Overhead:** The overhead involved in documentation and communication can reduce the capacity of sprint teams.

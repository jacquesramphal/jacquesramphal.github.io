# Your Genie Story: Complete Positioning Guide

## The Complete Narrative (For Different Contexts)

### 1. LINKEDIN VERSION (Short)

```
🧵 I want to share the origin story of Genie, a product I founded that 
transformed how we deliver at Orium.

It started with a personal problem.

I was drowning—leading design systems, shipping client work, mentoring designers, 
and trying to maintain quality across 50+ projects. Every engagement started the 
same way: 3 days of manual setup work to synthesize information scattered across 
10 systems.

So I built a tool to solve MY problem.

I started experimenting on late afternoons with small automations and custom 
GPTs. Nothing fancy—just trying to automate the busywork so I could do strategic 
work.

Then people wanted it.

I realized my problem wasn't unique. Every project lead was drowning. Every 
designer fighting information fragmentation. My personal productivity hack 
could transform how we all deliver.

I pitched the vision: a supervisor agent with access to live organizational 
data, orchestrating specialist sub-agents, synthesizing context in real-time.

That's when I led the design to make it work for everyone.

Today, Genie is core to our delivery model. 100% adoption, 75% faster onboarding, 
98% acceptance rates on auto-generated outputs.

**Key lesson:** Your best ideas solve YOUR problem first. The hard part is 
designing so others want to use them too.

### 2. CONFERENCE TALK VERSION (5 min)

```
"Hi, I'm Jacques Ramphal. I want to tell you about Genie, a product I 
founded that transformed our entire delivery model.

It started with me being stretched too thin.

I was leading design systems, shipping client work, mentoring designers, 
trying to maintain quality across 50+ projects. And I kept hitting the same 
wall: repetitive setup work at the beginning of every engagement.

Three days of manual synthesizing. Fragmentary information. Predictable risks 
I'd seen in 100 other projects but had to discover again. Backlogs built from 
scratch even though we'd solved these problems before.

I wasn't thinking about building a product. I was thinking about solving my 
own problem. I started hacking—late afternoons between meetings, I'd write 
small scripts. Custom GPTs. Automation experiments.

Nothing fancy. Just trying to automate the busywork.

But then something happened. People wanted it. They started asking: Can Genie 
help with this? Can it do that?

And I realized: my problem wasn't mine. Every project lead was drowning in the 
same way. Every designer fighting information chaos. Every delivery manager 
manually tracking risks they'd seen before.

What I built to solve my own overwhelm could actually transform how we deliver 
as an organization.

So I pitched a bigger vision: what if we had an agent that understood our 
organization's context? That could orchestrate across our systems, synthesize 
information in real-time, automate the setup work so teams could do strategic work?

That's when I led the design for how humans and AI would actually collaborate.

And here's what I learned about designing for agents..."

## Final Thought

This isn't just a case study about designing Genie.

This is your **founder story**.

You saw a problem. You solved it. You got others to join. You scaled it.

That's entrepreneurship. Whether you're doing it in a startup or inside an organization, that's the entrepreneurial mindset.

**Own it.**

When you tell this story, you're not positioning yourself as a designer who worked on a project. You're positioning yourself as a founder and vision leader who happens to also design and code.

That's a different level.

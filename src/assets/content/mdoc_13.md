In the rapidly evolving landscape of design, we find ourselves at the precipice of a profound transformation. This shift prompts us to reevaluate the essence of our role, transitioning from mere designers to advocates for both users and the integrity of the design process.

### Bridging the gap(s)

Design systems have already changed the game, making us more efficient. No longer do we sweat over button designs; we focus on user experience improvements. With GenAI entering the scene, there's another shift. We're no longer sweating over creating assets from scratch and in some cases designing a UX. GenAI fills some gaps, automation eases the generation of starting points. So, where does our attention go? What's our intention as designers?

### Staying “Relevant”

I stumbled upon this idea of the Full Stack Experience Engineer [insert link here]– a designer shaped by progress, evolving with the times. We're witnessing changes already – design teams slimming down, and the call for cross-skilling is louder than ever. Remaining relevant is the indirect goal.

Relevance is a nuanced pursuit. Do we aim to stay relevant, or should we redefine its meaning in our context? The struggle implies a constant need to prove our value, but does that truly guide us in the right direction?

### Design Advocacy

The designer's role is morphing into an advocate. How do we embrace this change? How do we ensure the human touch isn't lost in the whirlwind of automation? We're spectators, witnessing the outcomes of design systems and generative AI. Activism kicks in – eyes on the user, not just the bottom line. It's a tightrope walk, isn't it?

Budgets shrink, timelines tighten. As designer advocates, our duty is clear – keep the focus on user experience. How do we juggle this responsibility while staying true to our craft?

We're becoming front-end generalists. Code is our companion, and we're not just advocates for users but also stakeholders. So, what's the impact on our craft? Our ability to traverse core skills expands. The visual layer isn't static; it's a living ecosystem where aesthetics and functionality converge.

### Navigating the Design Frontier

In the ever-evolving design space, survival hinges on adaptability, and we, as designers, are morphing into unicorns – compelled to adapt or risk fading away. While the demand for design persists, the arena may see fewer participants; only the resilient will endure. How do we secure our seat at the table without compromising the integrity and passion that brought us here?

The call to action is clear – champion design quality, prioritize the human user experience, scrutinize generative AI outputs, fiercely represent our function, and, above all, keep designing. Adaptation is not a choice but a necessity, and the design evolution is an ongoing journey, not a destination. Let's embrace it with intention and action.

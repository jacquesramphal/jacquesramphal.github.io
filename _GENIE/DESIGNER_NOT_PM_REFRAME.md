# Critical Reframe: You’re a Designer, Not a PM

## What You Clarified

You said: **”I was still doing design-related work. Genie allowed me to deliver more repeatable outcomes while bringing creativity back to my work.”**

This completely changes the narrative. It’s not about becoming a PM or scaling impact generically. **It’s about automating the routine parts of design so you can reclaim the creative parts.**

## The Complete Reframe

### OLD NARRATIVE (Generic)
- Wearing multiple hats
- Doing repetitive setup work
- Building a product to multiply impact
- Became: AI developer + product manager

### NEW NARRATIVE (Specific to Design)
- Wearing multiple design hats (audits, user stories, component mapping, quality)
- Spending creative energy on routine design tasks
- Built agent to reclaim creativity
- Became: AI developer + designer who codes
- **Stayed: A designer focused on UX, user connection, and front-end quality**

## What Changed in the Case Study

### 1. **The Personal Problem** (REWRITTEN)

**OLD:**
“At the start of every project, I was doing repetitive work...”

**NEW:**
“I was wearing multiple hats at Orium, but they were all design-related:
- Leading design systems
- Running site audits and quality analysis
- Generating user stories and requirements
- Component mapping and organization
- Front-end quality and fidelity

This was all **necessary work**. But it was repetitive. Work where I was spending creativity on routine instead of novel challenges.”

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Shows you’re a designer, not a PM
- ✅ Explains what you actually do
- ✅ Shows the specific work Genie automates
- ✅ Makes clear this is about reclaiming design focus

### 2. **Why You Built It** (REFRAMED)

**OLD:**
“The challenge was to multiply my impact”

**NEW:**
“The challenge was to reclaim the creative parts of my work... to do work that only a designer can do... Genie was my way to get back to what I love about design.”

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Less about scale, more about focus
- ✅ Shows emotional/creative motivation
- ✅ Frames as reclamation, not just automation
- ✅ Emphasizes connection to design love

### 3. **The Spark** (REPOSITIONED)

**OLD:**
“I learned AI development because I was building an agent to multiply impact”

**NEW:**
“I learned tools I’d never used before—n8n, workflow orchestration, agentic AI patterns—to solve problems I’d never encountered. Problems for others that started with my own problems.”

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Shows learning for novel problems, not routine
- ✅ Emphasizes you’re exploring new territory
- ✅ Connects personal growth to solving others’ problems
- ✅ Shows this is about capability expansion for design challenges

### 4. **The Scaling** (REFOCUSED ON DESIGN)

**OLD:**
“Building it transformed me into product manager + AI developer”

**NEW:**
“I stayed a designer. I stayed connected to what I love about design—solving for users, understanding their needs. Genie just gave me back the time and creative energy to focus on that.”

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ Clarifies you didn’t abandon design
- ✅ Shows Genie enabled better design thinking
- ✅ Emphasizes user connection as core to who you are
- ✅ Frames growth as expanding capability while staying true to design

## Your Core Identity (Now Clear)

### WHO YOU ARE
- **Primary:** UX Designer focused on front-end quality
- **Strength:** Connection with clients and users
- **Growth:** Now also an AI developer and product thinker
- **But:** Still a designer first

### WHAT YOU DO
- Site audits and quality analysis
- User story and requirement generation
- Component mapping and design systems
- UX and front-end implementation
- Now: Building agentic systems to make that work better

### WHY YOU BUILT GENIE
- Not to become a PM
- Not to scale generically
- **To reclaim the creative parts of design work**
- **To automate the routine so you could focus on novel user problems**

## The Complete New Arc

```
DESIGNER DROWNING IN ROUTINE
        ↓
INSIGHT: Routine = Creative Drain
        ↓
BUILDS AGENT TO AUTOMATE ROUTINE
        ↓
LEARNS AI/WORKFLOW FOR NOVEL PROBLEMS
        ↓
SCALES TO TEAM (SO THEY CAN RECLAIM CREATIVITY TOO)
        ↓
STAYS A DESIGNER
        ↓
BUT NOW: Designer + AI Developer + Product Thinker
        ↓
OUTCOME: More time for creative/user-focused work
```

## Why This Is More Powerful

### For Other Designers
**Signal:** “I don’t abandon design to scale. I use technology to protect design focus.”

### For Your Team
**Signal:** “This is about reclaiming what we love about design, not becoming something we’re not.”

### For Clients
**Signal:** “More focus on understanding your users and their real problems.”

### For Your Identity
**Signal:** “I’m still a designer. Always. The tools expand, the love doesn’t change.”

## Your New Opening (Key Section)

### The Personal Problem (NEW)

“I was wearing multiple hats at Orium, but they were all design-related:
- Running site audits, analyzing UX flows, identifying quality gaps
- Generating user stories from scope documents, mapping user needs to features
- Organizing and cataloging components, documenting API surfaces
- Ensuring design fidelity in development

This was all necessary work. But it was repetitive. I was spending creativity on routine when I should have been spending it on novel problems.

**The insight:** What if I could automate the routine design work so I could reclaim that creative energy?”

### Why It Matters

“I love design. I love solving user problems. I love the craft of front-end quality. But I was spending too much time on the mechanical parts of design work when I could be spending that time on the creative parts.”

## The Bottom Line

You’re not becoming a PM. You’re not abandoning design. You’re **using technology to reclaim your creative focus**.

That’s a completely different story.

That’s a more authentic story.

That’s a more powerful story.

**Because it’s true to who you are.**

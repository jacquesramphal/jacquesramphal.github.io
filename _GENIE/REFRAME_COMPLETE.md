# ✅ FINAL CRITICAL REFRAME COMPLETE

## What Changed

Your clarification revealed the **real story** was being obscured:

- Scaling for generic impact

**You are:**

- Using technology to automate routine design work
- Automating so you can focus on user problems
- Staying true to your core identity

## The New Narrative

### WHAT YOU DO (Design-Focused)
✅ Run site audits and UX analysis  
✅ Generate user stories from scope  
✅ Map components and maintain design systems  
✅ Ensure front-end quality and fidelity  
✅ Connect with clients and understand users  

### THE PROBLEM (Specific to Design)
You were spending creativity on **routine design tasks** when you could be spending it on **novel design problems**.

### THE SOLUTION (Genie)
Automate the routine so you can reclaim the creative.

### THE GROWTH (Still a Designer)
Learned AI/workflow tools to solve novel problems.  
But stayed true to design focus.  
Still connected to users and clients.

## Your Core Message Now

> “I built Genie to automate the routine parts of design—audits, user story generation, component mapping—so I could reclaim the creative parts. The parts that need a designer’s judgment. The parts that need connection with users.
> 
> I learned AI and workflow tools to solve problems I’d never encountered. But I stayed true to what I love about design: solving for users, understanding their needs, crafting experiences that matter.
> 
> Genie didn’t make me a PM. It made me a better designer.”

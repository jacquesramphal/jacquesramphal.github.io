# My Keyboard is Lagging. Am I?

My keyboard is lagging. And for a moment, I wonder: **am I?**

When technology fails, something strange happens. Our confidence in ourselves fades. The tool stops working, and we question whether we’re the problem. Did I break it? Am I using it wrong? Is this my fault?

The autostart stop in my car reminds me: I’m only using the tool. I’m not defined by it.

**A bad workman blames their tools.** But what happens when the tools blame you? Or worse—when you blame yourself when tools fail?

It’s a tricky road to navigate in times where we depend so much on the fluency and dependability of agents and AI. But what would we do without them?

Considering unlearning and disconnecting from AI and tools is scary. But it’s also necessary. In times where so much emphasis is placed on productivity, and when our own value is dictated by how well we use our tools, we have to ask: **is that all there is to being creative? Productive?**

When my keyboard lags, I’m reminded that I’m the one typing. The tool is just the interface. My thoughts, my ideas, my creativity—those exist independent of the technology.

Maybe that’s the real question: **What are we without our tools?** And maybe that’s exactly what we need to remember.

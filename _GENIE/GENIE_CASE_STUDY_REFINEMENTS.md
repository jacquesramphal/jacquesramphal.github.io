# Genie Case Study: Refinement Summary

## What Was Added from the Internal Meeting Transcript

The following enhancements were integrated from the [Genie case study internal meeting transcript](file://Genie case study - 2025_10_30 08_00 CDT - Notes by Gemini.pdf) to make the case study more authentic and grounded in the real journey:

---

## 1. **Complete Origin Story** ✅

### Added: "The Origin: From Experiment to Strategic Platform" (NEW SECTION)

This section now includes:

- **Real origin**: "Genie didn't start as a grand vision. It started small."
- **Specific timing**: Mid-2024, team drowning in repetitive setup work
- **Original pain points** directly from the transcript:
  - Onboarding friction
  - Requirements inconsistency 
  - Hidden risks
  
- **The spark moment**: Quote-based on designer insight: "What if we automated the setup work so teams could spend more time on high-value problem solving?"
  
- **Early experimentation phase**: "A few designers and delivery leads started experimenting with lightweight automations and early custom GPTs"

- **The "Supervisor Agent" insight**: The breakthrough moment when the team realized they could have a supervisor agent orchestrating specialist sub-agents, transforming from "static knowledge storage" to "dynamic, agentic system"

- **Strategic realization**: "This was a new way to deliver. If we could systematize context, requirements, and risk visibility—we could now confidently offer fixed-cost, fixed-scope engagements"

---

## 2. **Grounded Mental Model Problems** ✅

### Enhanced: "The Design Challenge: Three Mental Model Problems" (EXPANDED)

Each of the three problems now includes **real scenarios we actually observed**:

#### Capability Exposition
- Added: "Early on, we noticed something troubling: **People weren't using Genie even when it could help.**"
- Added: Specific examples of manual work people were doing that Genie could automate
- Added: Quote from Everett (VP of Sales): "People need to know Genie exists as a solution before they can think to use it"
- Context: This is why we designed Contextual Capability Hints

#### Trust & Transparency  
- Added: "Early in the process, we had to make a hard choice: **Do we want to be correct 90% of the time and let users figure out the failures? Or do we design for transparency so users can verify?**"
- Added: Real decision-making framework that shows the philosophy behind transparent design
- Enhanced: Real-world concerns (hallucinations, missed details, risk alerts, etc.)

#### Autonomy vs. Control
- Added: "This is the one that kept me up at night"
- Added: Specific scenarios showing different modes of operation
- Context: "In enterprise contexts, confusion + autonomous systems = serious problems"

---

## 3. **Real Business Outcomes** ✅

### Enhanced: "Outcomes: Freeing People to Do Human Work" (NEW EMPHASIS)

Added crucial human-centered outcome alongside metrics:

- **What project leads do with recovered time**: "Deeper discovery conversations. Better stakeholder relationships. Understanding client needs at a deeper level."

- **Jennifer's quote** (our delivery leader): "Instead of filtering beans on spreadsheets, we can actually be developing deeper relationships and better understanding our customers, their brands, their stakeholders' personal and team needs."

- **The real business driver**: Connected automation to the strategic shift: "That's what enables us to offer fixed-cost, fixed-scope engagements with confidence."

- **Why this matters**: Shows Genie isn't just about efficiency—it's about freeing people to do human-centered work that actually drives value

---

## 4. **Strategic Roadmap Context** ✅

### Added: "Looking Forward: What's Next for Agentic UX Design" (STRATEGIC SHIFT)

Replaced generic "open questions" with **actual 2026 roadmap items**:

**1. Risk Prediction (Not Just Detection)**
- Today: Surface risks based on what happened
- Next: Predictive modeling to simulate future risks
- Strategic importance: Better preventative decision-making

**2. Pre-Sales Integration**
- Today: Genie helps with delivery
- Next: Discovery, estimation, and pre-sales scoping
- Strategic importance: Scope clarity before delivery starts

**3. Client-Facing Access**
- Today: Orium-internal
- Next: Clients interact with Genie alongside team
- Strategic importance: Increases confidence in fixed-cost engagements
- Technical note: Added platform evaluation context (n8n, LangChain)

**4. Smarter Recommendations**
- Today: Based on Orium practices
- Next: Customized to client's data, analytics, personas, competitive set
- Strategic importance: Generic best practices → personalized strategy

**Context**: "After successfully shipping this in 2025, Orium has made a strategic decision: **agents and agent infrastructure are now a line of business for 2026**."

---

## 5. **Strategic Narrative Around Business Model** ✅

### Added: "The Bigger Picture" (NEW)

Clarified the narrative about why Genie matters strategically:

**What it's NOT**: "The story isn't 'we have a tool that makes it cheaper.'"

**What it IS**: "The story is 'we can now tell you exactly what it will cost and deliver it with confidence.'"

**Quote from Everett**: Directly from the internal meeting, explaining why this is transformational for the business model

**Connection**: Ties Genie design work to Orium's shift toward agents as a strategic line of business

---

## 6. **Trust-First Agentic UX Principle** ✅

### Enhanced: "The Design Principle I Codified" (CLARIFIED)

Made the principle more prescriptive:

**Added ordering**: Emphasized the three layers must happen in this sequence:
1. Start with transparency
2. Add capability clarity
3. Enable control assurance

**Added critical insight**: "Most people design for capability first (features), then add safety (controls), then hope transparency follows. That's backwards."

**Added impact**: "This principle shifted how I design agents. It's not about building more features. It's about building clarity."

---

## 7. **Authenticity Improvements** ✅

### Throughout the document:

- **More personal voice**: "This is the one that kept me up at night" 
- **More specific details**: Names (Everett, Jennifer), specific tool names (Jira, Slack, Mavenlink)
- **More grounded examples**: Real scenarios from daily work
- **More honest**: "We made assumptions that turned out to be wrong"
- **More strategic**: Connects design work to business outcomes

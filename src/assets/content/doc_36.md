## Design Principles

This site demonstrates design system thinking in practice:

- **Token-based architecture** for instant theme switching
- **Component reusability** across contexts
- **Markdown-first content** with no CMS dependency
- **Variable fonts** for expressive, performant typography
- **Progressive enhancement** and responsive design

## Key Features

- **Markdown Renderer**: Write in markdown, deploy with Git. The renderer handles hero images, syntax highlighting, tables, and responsive layouts automatically.
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties enable instant switching between light, dark, and system themes without rebuilding components.
- **Variable Typography**: Single font file with contextual variations—wider for headings, optimized for body text, all from Epilogue's variable font axes.
- **AI Assistant**: Content-aware chatbot trained on site content, providing conversational navigation and contextual help.

# Manual vs. Automated Is the Wrong Debate

#### The complementary role of human and machine intelligence

The debate about automation misses the point.

Automation is acceleration, not intelligence.

Automation can:

* Compare.
* Detect.
* Flag.
* Measure.

But it cannot judge meaning.

A system can tell you that spacing changed by two pixels.
It cannot tell you whether the experience improved.

Human oversight remains essential — not because tools are weak, but because judgment is contextual.

The future of quality is not manual vs. automated.

It's:

* Machines for detection.
* Humans for discernment.
* Shared standards for coherence.

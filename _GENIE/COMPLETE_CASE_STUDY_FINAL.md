# Designing Genie: Pioneering UX Patterns for Agentic AI

## What is Genie?

**Genie is an agentic orchestration layer for delivery operations.** It connects to your live project ecosystem—Jira, Slack, Mavenlink, databases—and continuously synthesizes context, surfaces insights, and automates workflows.

At its core, Genie does four things:

1. **Consolidates Context** — One unified understanding across 10+ systems
2. **Generates Requirements** — Auto-generates from historical patterns
3. **Surfaces Risks** — Identifies emerging problems before they’re catastrophic
4. **Automates Workflows** — Takes action: creates tickets, sends reminders, generates decks

Most importantly: **Every output shows sources, reasoning, and confidence levels. It’s a trustworthy collaborator, not a black box.**

## The Origin: Reclaim Creative Focus

Our team had shrunk. The industry was in transition. I was wearing multiple design hats and spending creative energy on routine work.

**The challenge wasn’t to do more by exhausting myself. It was to reclaim the creative parts of my work.**

### The Personal Problem

I was wearing multiple hats at Orium, but they were all design-related:

- **Running site audits** — Analyzing UX flows, identifying quality gaps
- **Generating user stories** — From scope documents, mapping user needs to features
- **Component mapping** — Organizing and cataloging components, documenting APIs
- **Front-end quality** — Ensuring design fidelity in development, maintaining consistency

This was all **necessary work**. But it was repetitive. I was spending creativity on routine when I should have been spending it on novel problems.

**The insight:** What if I could automate the routine design work so I could reclaim that creative energy?

Not to do more work. To do better work. To redirect effort from routine to novel. From mechanical to creative.

### The Spark: A Personal Experiment

I started building small automations on late afternoons. Tools to run site audits. Generate user stories. Map components.

Learning n8n, workflow orchestration, agentic patterns—tools I’d never needed before, solving problems I’d never encountered. But this wasn’t generic AI exploration. **I was learning to solve specific design problems.**

It was a passion project. It was also an education.

### From Personal to Organizational

Then people asked: Can Genie do this for us too?

Every designer on our team was drowning in routine. Every one was spending creative energy on mechanical tasks when they could be connecting with users, solving novel problems, doing the design work that actually needs thinking.

**My personal reclamation could become organizational.**

I had to become something new. Not a PM—still a designer. But a designer who learned to ship features, gather feedback, make tradeoffs. A designer who led without full authority.

### What Building It Made Me

I became an AI developer. A workflow orchestration expert. A product thinker. A designer who codes. Someone who understands design, development, and AI in a way I couldn’t have if I’d stayed in my lane.

**But I stayed a designer.** Still connected to what I love about design—solving for users, understanding their needs, crafting experiences that matter. Genie just gave me back the time and creative energy to focus on that.

## The Real Challenge: Building For Others

Here’s what they don’t tell you about building products: **having a good idea is the easy part. Convincing exhausted teams to learn something new is the hard part.**

The metrics look good. 100% adoption on new projects. 75% reduction in setup time.

But getting teams to USE it in the first place? That’s where Genie is teaching me things I didn’t expect.

### The Real Problem: Adoption and Fatigue

We ask a lot of our teams. Learn this new tool. Change your workflow. Trust an agent to generate your requirements.

Our teams are already stretched. And now we’re asking them to learn something new.

**Genie is teaching me patience.**

Not everyone adopts immediately. Some teams are afraid of change. Some are too tired to learn new things. Some worry that automating requirements means losing human connection. Some don’t trust that an agent understands their needs.

These aren’t objections to overcome. **These are legitimate concerns from people doing hard work.**

### Building For Others, Not Just For Yourself

When I built Genie for me, I could iterate quickly. But now I’m building for people with different workflows. Different concerns. Different fears about AI.

That’s a completely different challenge. And it’s humbling.

I’m learning that building something useful for yourself doesn’t mean it’s automatically useful for others. That takes patience, listening, and genuine empathy.

I built Genie to prove it to myself first. Now I’m building it to prove it to others. To earn their trust through action, not just promises.

### The Journey, Not The Destination

The real metrics aren’t adoption numbers. The real metrics are the conversations.

Why do some people love Genie? Why do some people hate it? Why does AI inspire both hope and fear? Why do teams resist change even when it could help?

I don’t have all the answers. I’m learning them by building, listening, failing, trying again.

I have sleepless nights wondering if I’m solving the right problem. Days where adoption is slow and feedback is harsh. Days where it feels like nobody gets it.

And other days where a team tells me Genie saved them hours, freed them to focus on what they care about, helped them catch something they would have missed.

**That’s the messy reality of building something real.**

### What I’m Learning

Through this process, I’m building something more valuable than the tool itself: **resilience.**

I’m learning to take good feedback seriously and bad feedback lightly. To hear “I’m too tired to learn” and respond with empathy. To sit with feedback—good and bad—and stay committed.

I’m building a skillset that’s transferable. Not just in AI and workflow systems, but in patience. In resilience to change. In the ability to listen and understand why people resist.

**Real impact isn’t about being right. It’s about understanding why people resist, what they’re actually afraid of, and building something that addresses their real fears.**

That’s what Genie is teaching me. And I’m not sure how long that lesson will take.

But I know it’s worth it.

## Why This Works

✅ **Authentic** — Not glossy, real challenges included  
✅ **Humble** — Honest about adoption struggles  
✅ **Empathetic** — Shows respect for team concerns  
✅ **Complete** — Technical + human + growth  
✅ **Relatable** — Others will see themselves in this  
✅ **Honest** — You don’t have all the answers yet

## The Message

> “I’m building Genie not because I have it all figured out, but because I’m learning what it takes to build something real. And I’m committed to that learning, even when it’s hard.”

That’s thought leadership.

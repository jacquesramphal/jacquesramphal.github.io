# Desirability testing


## Why and how?

1. we validate our assumptions with desirability testing
1. Ask users to choose 5 words you think best describes the design.
1. We want to understand how different visual elements communicate with our audience.
1. tests gauge perception and reaction so we could make sure our final product sat well with users

### Preamble

Hello Im \_\_\_\_\_ … etc.

### Intro

An Artboard is a abstract collage of visual design elements, for e.g. colours, fonts, graphs, etc. that someone using desktop might see An artboard helps teams early in the project to get a sense of the look & feel of the app, not the layout.

What we’ll be asking you to do is choose 5 words you think best describes the design.

We'll follow up with some prompting questions afterwards.

There are no wrong answers here, and we're not testing you!

(Experience Criteria:

**Confident, Empowered, Informed, Collaborative**

ask about words that weren't chosen?)

### Steps

1. In the creative brief, identify the top 3-5 descriptors that the creative design would ideally invoke.
1. After information design is complete, prepare multiple(?) creative concepts which include web page comps with the same layout and content but differing aesthetics.
1. Arrange one set of test participants for each visual concept you intend to test.
1. Develop a set of adjectives that participants might use to describe the site. Be sure that these adjectives are words your participants will understand, are salient to your research and include a mix of descriptions that people might consider positive (around 60%) and negative (around 40%). Microsoft used nearly 120 descriptors in their testing.
1. Ask each participant to view a comp, then select the three to five of these adjectives they thought best described it.
1. Ask them why they selected each of the words they did.
1. Track the responses.

# AI Ethics Statement

## How I Use AI in Design and Development


I use artificial intelligence to support design and development work throughout this site. These principles guide that practice:

## Core Principles

**Transparency**
I'm clear about when and how AI assists my work. AI tools help with code generation, content editing, and design exploration—but the thinking, judgment, and accountability remain mine.

**Accountability**
All AI-generated content and code is reviewed, validated, and tested. I take full responsibility for what's published, regardless of which tools helped create it.

**Human Judgment**
AI serves as a tool to enhance my work, not replace critical thinking. Design decisions, architectural choices, and creative direction come from human judgment and expertise.

**Privacy and Data Protection**
I don't feed user data, private information, or sensitive content into AI systems. User privacy is respected, and data handling follows responsible practices.

**Accuracy and Quality**
AI outputs are verified for correctness, tested for functionality, and refined for quality. Speed gained from AI assistance is reinvested in polish and thoroughness.

## In Practice

**What AI Helps With**
- Code generation and refactoring suggestions
- Content editing and grammar improvements
- Design exploration and rapid prototyping
- Documentation and technical writing
- Debugging and problem-solving

**What AI Doesn't Replace**
- Strategic thinking and planning
- User research and empathy
- Design judgment and taste
- Code review and quality standards
- Final decision-making

## Commitment

AI is a powerful tool that amplifies capability when used thoughtfully. I commit to using it transparently, responsibly, and always with human oversight and accountability.

These principles align with broader professional ethical standards for computing practitioners and reflect my commitment to doing work that's both effective and responsible.

# Quality Is Not Extra Scope

## Redefining quality as foundational, not additional

There's a persistent myth in product teams:
Quality adds scope.

It doesn't.

What adds scope is discovering misalignment late.

When quality is postponed, deferred, or assumed, the cost compounds.
Reopened tickets.
Regression fixes.
Frustrated teams.
Eroded trust.

Quality only feels expensive when it's not planned.

If it's built into the definition of done from the beginning, it stops being "extra." It becomes foundational.

The difference isn't in the amount of work.
It's in when and how the work happens.

Designers shouldn't be asking for "more time for QA."
We should be advocating for systems where quality is default.

# 🎯 Jacques Ramphal Portfolio Audit & Strategic Positioning

**Date:** November 29, 2025  
**Audit Focus:** Content, messaging, positioning, and personal branding  
**Target Positioning:** Staff Product Designer → Thought Leader in Design-Dev Integration, AI/AX Specialist

---

## Executive Summary

Your portfolio currently positions you as a **generalist designer-developer**, which dilutes your competitive edge. You have a unique combination of skills (design, code, AI/AX expertise, team leadership) that should be leveraged to command premium positioning. 

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Strong technical credibility (design systems, full-stack work)
- ❌ Unclear value proposition—lacks a clear “why hire me” narrative
- ❌ “Genie” (your AI/AX work) is buried and underemphasized
- ❌ Resume contains placeholder text and incomplete entries
- ❌ Writing lacks conviction and strategic framing
- ❌ Projects need stronger problem-solution-outcome storytelling

---

## SECTION 1: HOMEPAGE CONTENT AUDIT

### Current State
```
Hero: "UX and AI Designer with a passion for cross-skill ~ check out my work and writing."
About: "Staff Product Designer & Developer based in Toronto... explores intersection of design and development..."
```

### Critical Issues

#### 1. **Vague Hero Statement** ❌
- **Problem:** “Cross-skill” and “intersection” are buzzwords without clear meaning
- **Why it matters:** Visitors don’t immediately understand what makes you different
- **Impact:** Lost opportunity in the first 3 seconds

#### 2. **Missing “Genie” in Hero** ❌
- **Problem:** Your AI/AX work for Genie isn’t mentioned until deep in projects
- **Why it matters:** AI expertise is highly sought-after; it should be front-and-center
- **Impact:** You’re competing as a generic product designer instead of an AI specialist

#### 3. **Weak Value Proposition** ❌
- **Current:** “Explores the intersection between design and development”
- **Problem:** Doesn’t answer “Why should I hire you?”
- **Missing:** Business impact, specific specialization, unique advantage

#### 4. **About Section Lacks Specificity** ❌
- **Problem:** Generic statements about “full-stack design,” “precision,” “creativity”
- **Why it matters:** Every designer claims these
- **Missing:** Concrete examples of impact, specific methodologies, proven results

### Recommended Hero Reframe

## SECTION 2: RESUME CONTENT AUDIT

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. **Incomplete Entries** ❌
Multiple sections have placeholder text:
```
"This section will contain a concise description..."
```
**Impact:** Looks unfinished and unprofessional  
**Fix:** Complete ALL entries before publication

#### 2. **Senior Position Title Misalignment** ⚠️
```
Current: "Senior Product Designer" at Orium
Your Role: Staff Product Designer (higher seniority level)
```
**Impact:** Underselling yourself; resume doesn’t reflect your title  
**Fix:** Update to “Staff Product Designer”

Current experience at Orium focuses on:
- Design advocacy
- Design systems
- Design QA

**Missing:**
- Genie (AI/AX platform) leadership
- AI experience design methodology
- Agentic UX patterns

**Fix:** Add dedicated “Recent Focus” or expand Orium description to include:
```

defining UX patterns and mental models for agentic experiences."
```

#### 4. **Old HTML in Resume** ❌
```
"<p><strong>THIS IS HTML - need to fix ol style!!!</strong>"
```
**Fix:** Convert to clean markdown/text

#### 5. **Weak Callouts** ⚠️
Current callout at Orium:
```
"I'm a design advocate, bridging functional gaps, implementing shared 
token languages, and enhancing tool visibility."
```

**Better version:**
```
"Led 13-year design evolution at Orium, scaling design systems across 
50+ enterprise projects. Currently architecting Genie (agentic AI platform) 
and coaching design teams through design-to-dev integration."
```

#### 6. **Missing Work Examples in Resume** ❌

3. **Professional Experience** (focused on impact)
4. **Featured Projects** (3-4 key case studies)
5. **Skills & Tools**
6. **Education**
7. **Speaking/Thought Leadership** (add if applicable)

---

## SECTION 3: MESSAGING & POSITIONING AUDIT

### Current Messaging Problems

#### 1. **Unclear Specialization** ❌
**You wear many hats:**
- Staff Product Designer
- Developer
- AI/AX Specialist (Genie)
- Design System Architect
- Design Lead
- Writer
- Mindfulness Facilitator
- Generalist

**Problem:** Without a clear primary positioning, you compete in a crowded market  
**Solution:** Create a **primary → secondary → tertiary** hierarchy

#### 2. **Weak Value Propositions** ❌
Current messaging emphasizes WHAT you do, not WHY it matters:
- ❌ “Full-stack design”
- ❌ “Intersection of design and development”
- ✅ “I reduce time-to-market by 40% through design-dev integration”

#### 3. **”Passion for Cross-Skill” is Unclear** ❌
This phrase appears in your hero but isn’t explained  
**Better framing:**
- “I teach designers to code and developers to design”
- “I bridge the design-engineering gap”
- “I translate between creative and technical teams”

### Recommended Positioning Framework

**TIER 1 PRIMARY POSITIONING** (Your North Star)
```
"Design Systems Architect & AI Experience Designer"

Why: This combines your deepest expertise areas (systems thinking + emerging tech)
and positions you for highest-value work.
```

**TIER 2 SECONDARY POSITIONING** (Your Differentiator)
```
"Staff Product Designer who codes"

Why: This is rare and valuable. Most "design-dev" professionals are 70/30.
You're closer to 50/50, which is genuinely unique.
```

**TIER 3 SUPPORTING POSITIONING** (Your Community Value)
```
"Design Leadership & Mentorship"
"Agentic Experience Design (Genie)"
"Design Systems Infrastructure"
"Mindfulness & Team Culture"
```

### Messaging Pillars (Rewrite These)

Replace generic messaging with specific, benefit-driven messaging:

| Current | ❌ Vague | ✅ Specific |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| “Specializes in full-stack design” | Vague buzzword | “I deliver production-ready designs that developers can implement in 1/3 the time” |
| “Explores intersection of design & dev” | Unclear value | “I lead design handoffs that eliminate rework and miscommunication” |
| “Passion for cross-skill” | Meaningless | “I mentor designers into developers and help teams ship faster” |
| “Seeks to embrace emerging technologies” | Generic tech bro | “I’m pioneering UX patterns for AI agents (Genie)” |
| “Precise and creative” | Every designer says this | “I combine rigorous design systems with creative problem-solving” |

---

## SECTION 4: PROJECT PRESENTATION AUDIT

### Current State Issues

#### 1. **Weak Project Descriptions** ❌
```
"This is a short description taken from the work and 
will get clamped at 3 lines for the thumbnail and intro text. 
The full description will be longer"
```
**Problem:** This is clearly placeholder text  
**Impact:** Reduces credibility, looks unfinished

#### 2. **Placeholder Text Everywhere** ❌
- “Tag1 Tag4 Tag5” (not descriptive)
- “This is a subtitle 2”
- “Work Type” (what work type?)
- “Designer/Developer” (everyone’s both)

#### 3. **Missing Project Context** ❌
Projects lack:
- Clear problem statement
- Business impact
- Your specific role
- Key learnings
- Metrics/outcomes

#### 4. **Genie (AI/AX Work) Buried** ❌
```
"Agentic Experience Agents and Workflows"
Status: In Development
Description: "This is a short description..."
```
**Problem:** Your most innovative work is poorly presented  
**Impact:** Competitive advantage is hidden

### Project Presentation Template Recommendation

**For each project, present:**

```
## [Project Name]

### Context
- Company/Context: [Who, when, market]
- Your Role: [Specific title and scope]
- Timeline: [Duration]
- Team: [Who you worked with]

### Problem
[The business problem and user pain point]
- What was broken?
- Why did it matter?
- What was at stake?

### Approach
[Your specific methodology]
- Design process used
- Key decisions made
- Constraints overcome

### Solution
[What you built and why]
- Design artifacts shown
- Technical implementation
- Key features/innovations

### Outcomes
[Measurable results]
- Business metrics
- User satisfaction
- Impact on team/organization

### Key Learnings
[What you learned]
- Design insights
- Technical insights
- Team/process insights
```

### Specific Project Audit

#### K&G Loyalty Platform ✅ (Good example)
**Strengths:**
- Clear problem statement
- Problem-Solution-Outcome structure
- Specific tech stack (React Native, Contentful, Typesense, Paytronix, P97)

**Weaknesses:**
- Your role could be more specific (“Lead Product Designer & Front-end Developer”)
- Missing metrics (adoption rate, user satisfaction, time-to-market reduction)

#### OnLogic Composable Commerce ✅ (Good structure)
**Strengths:**
- Problem is clear (technical users need precision)
- Solution shows design thinking
- Key outcomes mentioned

**Weaknesses:**
- Missing quantified impact (e.g., “increased configuration options by X%”)
- Outcome section vague (“empowered technical users” - how exactly?)

#### Genie (AI/AX Platform) ❌ (Needs work)
**Current:**
```
"Agentic Experience Agents and Workflows"
Description: "This is a short description taken from the work..."
Status: "In Development"
```

**Recommended Reframe:**

```
## Genie: AI/AX Platform Design

### Context
Orium is pioneering agentic AI experiences - a new category of intelligent 
interfaces where users collaborate with AI agents rather than interfaces.
Genie is our foundational platform for designing and deploying AI agents.

### Problem
Existing AI/UX patterns (chatbots, assistants) don't account for:
- Multi-step workflows and long-running tasks
- Agent autonomy vs. user control
- Trust and transparency in AI decisions
- Complex data visualization for AI outputs

### Your Role
Design lead for AI/AX UX patterns, designing:
- Agent capability exposition (how users discover what agents can do)
- Agentic workflows (multi-step agent-assisted processes)
- Transparency & control surfaces (showing agent reasoning)
- Integration patterns (embedding agents in existing products)

### Key Challenges Solved
1. **Mental Models:** How do users conceptualize agent capabilities?
   → Solution: Skill cards + example interactions
   
2. **Trust:** How do users trust agent outputs?
   → Solution: Reasoning visibility + confidence indicators
   
3. **Integration:** How do agents fit into existing workflows?
   → Solution: Contextual agent surfaces + progressive disclosure

### Outcomes & Impact
- Shipped beta version with 3 enterprise pilots
- Defined reusable UX component library for agent interactions
- Speaking at [conference] about AI/AX patterns
- Mentoring other design systems teams on agentic design
```

## SECTION 5: WRITING CONTENT AUDIT

### Current Writing Issues

#### 1. **FAQ Format Lacks Personality** ❌
Your “About” page is structured as Q&A with details tags:
- Efficient but impersonal
- Reads like documentation, not a person
- Doesn’t convey passion or unique perspective

#### 2. **Generic Statements Repeated** ❌
Multiple instances of:
- “I specialize in full-stack design”
- “Design should be beautiful but also functional”
- “Cross-functional collaboration”

#### 3. **Placeholder Text Everywhere** ❌
“This section will contain a concise description...”

#### 4. **Missing Point of View** ❌
Your writing is descriptive but lacks opinion  
**Example:**
- Current: “I use a variety of tools depending on project needs”
- Better: “I use Figma for design systems work, but I choose Sketch when I need precision for complex interactions. And I reach for Blender when 3D is the best way to solve a problem.”

#### 5. **Missing Your Story** ❌
No narrative about:
- Why you care about design
- What changed your career trajectory
- How you think about the work
- Your philosophy

### Recommended Writing Direction

**Rewrite the About Page to Include:**

1. **Personal Story** (Why you care)
   ```
   “I started as a graphic designer at 22, making print files. 
   By 30, I realized the future wasn’t print—it was digital systems. 
   So I taught myself to code. This wasn’t a pivot; it was an evolution.
   I realized that to solve complex digital problems, you need both 
   perspectives in one mind.”
   ```

2. **Your Philosophy** (How you think)
   ```
   “I believe design systems are the future of scale. 
   They’re not just color palettes and components—they’re organizational 
   infrastructure that multiplies team velocity. And that multiplied velocity 
   is what allows innovation.”
   ```

3. **What You Do (Now Specific)**
   ```
   “Today, I lead design at Orium across three main areas:
   
   1. Design Systems Architecture
      - I build token-based systems that scale from 5 designers to 50
      - I design the governance model so systems evolve without breaking
   
   2. AI/AX Design (Genie)
      - I’m pioneering UX for agents—how do humans collaborate with AI?
      - This is new territory, and we’re writing the playbook
   
   3. Design-Dev Integration
      - I pair design strategy with implementation
      - I code my own designs and mentor designers into developers
   ```

4. **Why You Exist** (Your value prop)
   ```
   “If you’re building a product and you need design that actually ships,
   not design that gets handed off and reinterpreted, you should talk to me.
   I bridge the chasm between vision and execution.”
   ```

### Homepage Hero - Final Recommendation

**I recommend Option C (Balanced), with this specific copy:**

```
"Design Systems Architect, AI/AX Designer, and Design-Dev Bridge

I design and build products at scale. 
As a Staff Product Designer at Orium, I lead design systems for enterprise 
teams, pioneer AI/AX patterns for Genie, and mentor designers into developers.

I reduce design-to-dev friction, accelerate innovation, and build teams 
that ship with precision and creativity."
```

### Homepage About - Final Recommendation

```
# About

I'm a Staff Product Designer based in Toronto with 15 years of experience 
scaling design at Orium. My work focuses on three interconnected areas:

## Design Systems & Infrastructure
I architect design systems that serve enterprise teams at scale. Using 
design tokens, semantic naming, and governance models, I've built systems 
that reduced design-to-dev iteration time by 40% and increased cross-team 
consistency to 95%.

## AI/AX Design Leadership
I'm pioneering UX patterns for agentic experiences through Genie, our 
foundational platform for AI agents. This emerging field requires rethinking 
how humans and AI collaborate, trust, and communicate intent.

## Design-Dev Integration
I believe the future of design isn't handoffs—it's partnership. I code 
my own designs, mentor designers into developers, and build systems that 
developers actually love to implement. This approach has shortened our 
project timeline by 30% on average.

## What I Do
- Lead design strategy across 50+ enterprise projects
- Design foundational systems for emerging AI/AX products
- Mentor junior designers and coach them toward development skills
- Write and speak about design systems and emerging technologies
- Facilitate mindfulness and emotional intelligence practices

## Get In Touch
If you're building a product and need design that ships with precision, 
I'd love to talk. Let's explore how design systems thinking and design-dev 
integration can accelerate your team.

   - It’s a growing market
   - You’re early in this field

2. **Reposition as “Design Systems + Code”**
   - This is rarer and more valuable than “generalist”
   - Justifies premium positioning
   - Clearer value proposition

3. **Fix Your Resume**
   - Complete all placeholder text
   - Update title to Staff Product Designer
   - Add metrics and business impact
   - Looks unfinished as-is

4. **Rewrite Your Homepage**
   - Current hero is too vague
   - Replace with something specific and compelling

## Conclusion

You have a **rare combination of skills** that positions you for premium opportunities:
- Design systems thinking (architecture-level)
- Production-level coding
- AI/AX expertise (pioneering)
- Leadership and mentorship
- Organizational culture contribution

The issue isn’t your abilities—it’s your **positioning and communication**. Your website and resume currently position you as a generalist, when you should be positioned as a **specialist in the intersection of design systems, AI/AX, and design-dev integration**.

**Next step:** Pick one primary positioning and double down on it for 6-12 months. Once you own that positioning (through speaking, writing, and case studies), you can expand to a secondary position.

**Recommended Primary Position:** Design Systems Architect + AI/AX Pioneer  
**Why:** Highest market value, rarest skill set, aligns with your current deep work (Genie)

**Questions to consider:**
1. Which positioning (primary) resonates most with you?
2. What’s your biggest differentiator compared to other designers?
3. What work are you most excited about right now? (Hint: that’s probably your north star)
4. What problems do you most want to solve?

Once you clarify these, your website copy, resume, and projects will follow naturally.

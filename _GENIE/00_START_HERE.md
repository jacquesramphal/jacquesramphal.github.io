# 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Your Portfolio Audit & Genie Case Study

## The Situation

Your portfolio and positioning don’t match your actual capabilities and achievements.

**You are:**
- Staff Product Designer (not Senior)
- Founder of Genie (not just a designer)
- AI/AX Pioneer (not a generalist)
- Design Systems Architect (not a full-stack generalist)
- Thought Leader (not just executor)

**Your site currently says:**
“Generalist designer-developer with interest in cross-skill”

**It should say:**
“Design Systems Architect, AI/AX Pioneer, and founder of Genie—pioneering agentic UX patterns”

## The Critical Insight About Genie

**What you said:** “Genie was MY idea, not something I was brought into”

**This changes EVERYTHING:**

**Old Frame:** Designer hired to solve a problem
**New Frame:** Founder who identified a problem, built a solution, scaled it

This is the difference between:
- “I designed something” (medium credibility)
- “I founded something, led the vision, AND designed it” (high credibility)

## Why This Matters

You’re not competing effectively because you’re underselling yourself.

**Competitive Position Before:** Generic designer-developer (low-value, commodity market)

**Competitive Position After:** Design Systems Architect + AI/AX Pioneer + Founder (high-value, niche market)

### The Math
- Competing as generalist: $X
- Competing in design systems niche: $1.5X  
- Competing as AI/AX pioneer: $2X
- Competing as FOUNDER of Genie: $3X

Not just in salary. In every opportunity.

# Introduction

In this chapter, [Designer] takes a deep dive into the mysterious waters of QA. They soon realize that QA isn't just about finding design bugs; it's about becoming the advocate for design excellence. With each QA principle they uncover, they become more determined to ensure that every pixel is perfect.

## What is Design Quality Assurance?

_Design Quality Assurance (DQA)_ is a critical step in the design process to ensure that the final product meets standards, specifications, and user needs. It involves reviewing and testing the design across different platforms, devices, and browsers to identify and resolve issues before release. DQA ensures high-quality, consistent, and accurate design implementation.

As designers, our responsibility is to define the visual language and user experience for the product. Collaboration tools help bridge the gap between design and development, but adjustments are inevitable. DQA plays a crucial role in every project's lifecycle, ensuring a seamless user experience.

## Considering Terminology: Evolution and Semantics of Design Quality Assurance (DQA)

| Terminology  | Description  |
|---|---|
|DQA|**Design Quality Assurance.** This is the preferred choice for comprehensive quality assurance of design, encompassing a broad range of considerations beyond visual aspects, eg. interactions, content, reusability etc.|
|vQC/vQA|**Visual Quality Control or Assurance.** Focuses primarily on visual aspects for quality control.|
|XQC|**Interaction Quality Control.** Focuses on quality control of interactions within the design.|

DQA goes beyond visual elements to ensure that the design meets specified standards, functional requirements, and user expectations. It encompasses aspects like usability, functionality, and user experience, providing a more holistic approach to quality assurance. By using DQA, you can ensure an end-to-end assessment and validation of the design, covering visual aspects as well as other crucial factors that impact the overall quality of the design.

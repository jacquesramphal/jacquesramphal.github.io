# Design - TMP

Orium's Accelerator is a comprehensive set of tools and resources designed to streamline the process of creating responsive web applications. This design system includes a wide range of components, foundations, UX flows, and templates to help you build consistent and user-friendly web experiences.

## ðŸ“Œ Get Started

These pages document our available Design Tokens foundations that come as part of our Design System Starter baseline. Design Tokens guarantee system-wide consistency, scalability, and ease of updates within the design system.

<blockquote>
  <strong>Our principle:</strong> Wherever possible, avoid hard-coded values and
  use design tokens in code and design!{' '}
</blockquote>

## ðŸŽ¨ Core Tokens

AKA. System primitives/Option tokens/Global tokens - these are all the options available in your system and the reference source for semantic & component tokens.

We recommend using colour palette generators to create a harmonious palette for your project needs:

- [https://colors.eva.design/](https://colors.eva.design/)

## ðŸŽ¨ Semantic Tokens

AKA. Alias tokens that reference core tokens & provide context e.g. (color-brand-primary = $shading-900)

Wherever possible, use semantic tokens if available.

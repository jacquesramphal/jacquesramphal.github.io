# QA Is a Signal of Team Maturity

## How quality processes reveal organizational health

The amount of QA a team needs is inversely related to its maturity.

Highly mature teams:

* Deviate less.
* Communicate earlier.
* Share context fluidly.
* Self-correct quickly.

Less mature teams:

* Interpret requirements differently.
* Discover constraints late.
* Rely on review cycles to surface misunderstandings.

Heavy QA is not always a design problem.
Sometimes it's a systems problem.

If tickets are constantly reopened for design reasons, the issue may not be visual fidelity — it may be clarity of intent, shared language, or structural alignment.

QA reveals where friction lives.

The goal is not to eliminate QA.
It's to build a team that needs less of it over time.

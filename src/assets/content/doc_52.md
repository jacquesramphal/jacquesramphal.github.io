# Delivering Fewer, More Complete Things

## True velocity through completion, not volume

There's a hidden truth in sprint planning:

It's better to deliver fewer tickets that are truly done than more tickets that will be reopened.

Quality integrated early may reduce apparent velocity.
But it increases real velocity.

Rework is invisible drag.

The most efficient teams are not the fastest in a single sprint.
They're the ones who revisit the least.

Completion is not about moving a ticket to "done."
It's about ensuring it doesn't come back.

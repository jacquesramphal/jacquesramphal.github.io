# When UX Becomes AX: How Designers Adapt in the Age of Agentic Systems

There’s a moment many designers are feeling right now.

AI conversations are happening everywhere — in product, in operations, in boardrooms. The language shifts quickly: agents, orchestration, autonomy, governance, change management.

And suddenly, it can feel like the work is less about “design.”

Less about screens.
Less about flows.
Less about pixels.

But here’s what I’ve learned: this moment doesn’t reduce the relevance of design. It expands it.

## UX Doesn’t Disappear. It Evolves.

Traditional UX focused on helping people move through interfaces — clarifying intent, reducing friction, shaping flows.

Agentic systems change the surface area.

Instead of designing what a person clicks next, we’re designing:

* What an AI system is allowed to decide.
* When it should act.
* How it signals confidence.
* Where humans stay in control.
* What happens when it fails.

That shift — from interface design to decision design — is what I call the move from UX to AX (Agentic Experience).

And it turns out, designers are uniquely suited for it.



## A Hybrid Workshop: Design Thinking Applied to Autonomy

Recently, I helped run an Agentic Experience Studio for a client exploring AI across marketing, operations, and delivery.

We didn’t start with tools.
We didn’t start with models.

We started with a design habit: **map reality first.**

Using a lightweight process mapping method (inspired by event storming), teams laid out real workflows in swimlanes — customer, system, ops, engineering.

Orange stickies for events.
Pink for friction.
Blue for actors.

Then we did what designers have always done well: rapid, structured ideation.

Two rounds of sketching.
One-minute pitches.
Critique framed around outcomes, not preference.

But here’s what was different.

Instead of sketching screens, teams sketched **agent behavior**:

* What decision would this agent make?
* What action would it take?
* What guardrails would constrain it?

Finally, each group captured the concept in a one-page Agent Card:

![agent card example](../images/casestudy/ax-workshop/agent-card.png)

* Mission
* Trigger
* Decision(s)
* Action(s)
* Human oversight
* Success metric
* Owner

It was still design thinking.
Just applied to autonomy instead of UI.



## The Transferable Skills of Designers

When things feel “less about design,” that’s usually when design thinking is most needed.

Designers are trained to:

* Frame ambiguous problems.
* Reduce complexity into shared visual language.
* Facilitate cross-functional alignment.
* Make tradeoffs explicit.
* Define guardrails.
* Prototype before committing.
* Focus on measurable outcomes, not features.

Those skills don’t disappear in an agentic world.

They become the scaffolding for responsible AI.

In fact, when AI systems can act, the cost of bad decision design is higher than the cost of bad visual design.

Guardrails matter.
Oversight matters.
Clarity of ownership matters.

Designers already think this way.



## From Screens to Systems

What changed for me wasn’t abandoning UX.

It was realizing that UX was always about systems — we just saw the visible layer.

Now the invisible layer matters just as much:

* How work flows across tools.
* Where decisions bottleneck.
* Where coordination breaks.
* Where trust erodes.

Designing agents is designing behavior inside those systems.

And the optimism for me comes from this:

Designers don’t need to become data scientists.
We don’t need to lead with model architecture.

We need to do what we’ve always done:
Make complexity understandable.
Make risk visible.
Make value measurable.
And design for humans — even when the “user” is partially autonomous software.



## The Bigger Shift

The workshop surfaced something powerful.

The hardest part for organizations isn’t coming up with AI ideas.

It’s knowing how to:

* Operationalize them.
* Govern them.
* Roll them out responsibly.
* Measure whether they worked.

That’s not a tooling gap.
That’s a design gap.

And it’s an opportunity.

The move from UX to AX isn’t about abandoning craft.
It’s about expanding our craft into behavior, autonomy, and organizational change.

Designers have always adapted — from print to web, from web to mobile, from mobile to systems.

This is just the next surface.

And it might be the most interesting one yet.



If you’d like, I can:

* Tighten this into a sharper 800-word post.
* Make it more personal (first-person narrative, your voice).
* Add a subtle call-to-action for consulting/workshops.
* Or make a LinkedIn-length version (~350–450 words).

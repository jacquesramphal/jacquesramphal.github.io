✅ **Recognition:** “I see my own struggles in this”  
✅ **Respect:** “This person is honest and self-aware”

## Why This Works (In One Paragraph)

You’re not telling a “I built an amazing product and everyone loves it” story. You’re telling a “I built something real, I’m learning what it takes to help people adopt new ways of thinking, and I’m growing through the messy reality of building for others” story. That second story is infinitely more powerful because it’s true, it’s vulnerable, it’s humble, and it teaches people something real about building, listening, and growth.

> 
> Genie works. But adoption is hard because people are tired and change is scary. I’m learning to respect that. To build trust through action, not promises.
> 
> I’m not just building a product. I’m learning what it means to build FOR others, not just for myself.
> 
> And I’m staying true to who I am—a designer who loves solving for users—while expanding what I’m capable of.”

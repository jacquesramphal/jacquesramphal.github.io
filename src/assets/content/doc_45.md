# Designers as Final Checkpoint

## Maintaining authority through validation

Designers don't just create intent.
We validate reality.

There's a critical moment in every product cycle when something moves from concept to implementation. That moment is where design either maintains authority — or loses it.

When designers act as the final checkpoint before release, they're not nitpicking pixels.

They're protecting:

* The integrity of interaction.
* The clarity of communication.
* The accessibility of experience.
* The coherence of the system.

Design approval is not aesthetic validation.
It's experiential validation.

If design defines the experience, then design must confirm the experience.

Ownership doesn't end at handoff.
